## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and symptoms. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the facial asymmetry, screens for red flag symptoms (speech, swallowing, eye closure), and provides a reasonable, cautious explanation and plan. The patient responses are clear and realistic. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or contradictions are present.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses understanding. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any emotional impact or specific concerns (e.g., 'I'm worried it could be a stroke'), but this is not required.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and communicates clearly. For completeness, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's vascular history (carotid stent/stenosis) and mention that, given her history, they are being extra cautious. This would further ground the conversation in the patient's context.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate back-and-forth. The summary and plan are well-articulated. Consider a brief closing check-in (e.g., 'Any other questions or concerns?') to enhance rapport.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The advice to monitor for new symptoms and seek care if they develop is appropriate for a light case with no red flags.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what you’ve noticed or what’s been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've noticed that when I smile, the right side of my lip doesn't move as much as it used to. It's just something I've picked up on recently, and it has me a little concerned.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other changes—have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness elsewhere in your face or body?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness anywhere else—it's just the right side of my lip when I smile.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed this change—did it come on suddenly, or has it developed gradually over time?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it started, but I think it came on pretty suddenly. I just noticed it one day when I was smiling.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you experienced any trouble with speech, eating, or drinking—like difficulty pronouncing words, drooling, or food/liquid escaping from your mouth?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any trouble with speaking or eating. Food and drinks don't seem to escape from my mouth, and I'm not drooling.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to close your eye on the right side, or any increased tearing or dryness in that eye? Sometimes these can be related.

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any trouble closing my right eye, and I haven't noticed any extra tearing or dryness.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you first noticed this, has the movement changed at all—either improving or getting worse—or has it stayed about the same?

**Patient**: It's stayed about the same since I first noticed it. I haven't seen any improvement or worsening so far.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about possible triggers—have you had any recent infections, dental work, or injuries to your face or head before this started?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any infections, dental work, or injuries to my face or head before this started.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any sensations—do you feel any tightness, twitching, or unusual sensations in your lip or face when you try to smile or make other facial expressions?

**Patient**: No, I don't feel any tightness, twitching, or anything unusual in my lip or face when I smile or make other expressions.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’ve noticed a subtle change in your smile on one side, but without other symptoms like weakness elsewhere, trouble speaking or eating, or changes around your eye. This is reassuring, as more serious nerve issues usually come with additional problems like difficulty closing the eye, numbness, or more widespread weakness.

Sometimes, mild facial movement changes can happen for reasons like minor nerve irritation, muscle fatigue, or even unnoticed minor injuries. Since you haven’t had any infections or dental work and it hasn’t gotten worse, that’s also a good sign.

Right now, I’d suggest monitoring for any new symptoms—especially if you notice drooping of your face, trouble speaking or swallowing, or weakness in your arms or legs. Those would be reasons to seek care more urgently.

If the change persists or worsens, it may be helpful to have an in-person evaluation to check your facial muscles and nerves more closely. In the meantime, you don’t need to restrict your activities. If you have any questions or notice new changes, please let me know. Does this approach make sense to you?

**Patient**: That makes sense to me, thank you for explaining it. I’ll keep an eye out for any new changes like you mentioned. It’s reassuring to know I don’t need to change my routine right now.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 61-year-old woman presenting for left internal carotid artery stent placement due to significant carotid artery stenosis. She has a history of right internal carotid artery stenosis (75–80%), left internal carotid artery stenosis (65–70%), and a previously coiled anterior communicating artery aneurysm. On examination, she was in no acute distress, with a right carotid bruit and fine crackles at the lung bases that cleared with cough; neurologically, she had a decreased right lip movement with smile but otherwise normal findings. The documented diagnosis was left internal carotid artery stenosis. She underwent successful left carotid artery stent placement without intraoperative complications and was monitored postoperatively with stable vital signs and no mental status changes. At discharge, her condition was stable and her groin site was clean and intact. She was prescribed Plavix and aspirin and advised to follow up in two weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with concern about decreased movement of the right side of the lip when smiling. The symptom had a sudden onset and has remained stable without improvement or worsening. There are no associated symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness elsewhere, speech or eating difficulties, drooling, or changes in eye closure or tearing. The patient denies recent infections, dental work, facial or head injuries, and reports no abnormal sensations in the face. Relevant medical history, medications, and allergies are not specified. The clinical impression is a subtle change in unilateral facial movement without other neurological deficits, which is reassuring and less likely to represent a serious nerve issue. The treatment plan includes monitoring for new symptoms such as facial drooping, speech or swallowing difficulties, or limb weakness, with advice to seek urgent care if these develop. The patient was reassured and advised that no activity restrictions are necessary at this time.
