## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and the case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the onset, severity, and associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting, as well as about blood pressure and medication adherence. The reasoning about possible causes (mild GI upset, dehydration) is reasonable for a light case, and the advice given is safe and appropriate. The brief mention of confusion is acknowledged and monitored, which fits the mild presentation. No unsupported diagnoses or treatments are introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and mentions confusion when prompted, which is helpful. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any recent changes in diet, stress, or diabetes control if asked.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates thoroughness and clear communication. To further improve, the doctor could briefly ask about diabetes control (e.g., recent blood sugars or ketones), given the patient's history of type 1 diabetes and mild DKA, though this is not strictly necessary for a light case.

**Conversation Flow**: The conversation flows logically, with each question building on prior answers. The summary and advice are clear and well-structured.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The doctor appropriately advises when to seek urgent care and checks for medication adherence. Clarity is excellent throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in—how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been feeling pretty nauseous lately, and I've thrown up a couple times. That's mainly why I came in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when these symptoms started—how long have you been feeling this way?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it started, but I think it's been a couple of days now. The nausea just hasn't let up.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the vomiting—how many times have you thrown up in the past couple of days, and are you able to keep any food or liquids down?

**Patient**: I've thrown up a couple of times in the last two days. I can keep a little water down, but eating much is tough right now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily routine—are you still able to do most of your usual activities, or has this really slowed you down?

**Patient**: It's definitely slowed me down. I haven't really felt up to doing my normal things around the house.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask—have you noticed any other symptoms along with the nausea, like fever, stomach pain, diarrhea, or headache?

**Patient**: I haven't had a fever, stomach pain, diarrhea, or headaches. I have noticed my blood pressure has been higher than usual, though.

**Doctor**: Okay. Since you mentioned your blood pressure has been higher than usual, do you check it at home regularly? If so, what kinds of numbers have you been seeing lately compared to your usual readings?

**Patient**: Yes, I check my blood pressure at home. Lately, the numbers have been higher than what I usually see—more in the 150s over 90s, when I'm normally closer to 130s over 80s.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the vomiting—when it happens, is it right after eating or drinking, or does it seem to come on randomly throughout the day?

**Patient**: The vomiting usually happens after I try to eat or drink something. It doesn't really come on when I haven't had anything.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has your nausea and vomiting been getting better, worse, or about the same since it started a couple of days ago?

**Patient**: It's stayed about the same since it started. I haven't really noticed much improvement yet.

**Doctor**: From what you've described, it sounds like you've been dealing with persistent nausea and some vomiting for a couple of days, which has made it hard for you to eat or drink much and has also affected your usual activities. You haven't had other concerning symptoms like fever or pain, but your blood pressure has been running higher than normal.

Often, nausea and vomiting that come on over a short period like this can be caused by a mild stomach bug or irritation of the stomach lining—things that are usually self-limited and improve on their own with rest and hydration. However, it's important to keep an eye on your fluid intake and blood pressure, especially since your readings have been higher than usual.

Sometimes, not eating or drinking well can temporarily raise blood pressure, but if this persists or worsens, it's worth monitoring closely. I’d also like to make sure nothing else is contributing, such as changes in your medications or any new stressors.

For now, try to take small sips of clear fluids frequently—things like water, electrolyte solutions, or clear broths. Avoid heavy or greasy foods until your stomach feels better. If you become unable to keep fluids down at all, feel very weak or dizzy, notice confusion, or if your blood pressure continues to climb much higher than your usual, those would all be reasons to seek care more urgently.

Does anything seem to trigger the nausea, or have you noticed any patterns with certain foods or activities?

**Patient**: Nothing specific seems to set it off—it just happens after I try to eat or drink most things. I did feel a little confused earlier when this all started, but that seems a bit better now. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.

**Doctor**: Let me share my thoughts on what could be going on. From what you've described, this sounds most consistent with a mild gastrointestinal upset—possibly a viral stomach bug or irritation—which is common and often resolves on its own within a few days. The fact that you’re able to keep some fluids down is reassuring, though it’s important to continue sipping fluids to prevent dehydration.

Your higher blood pressure readings could be related to your body’s response to not feeling well or being a bit dehydrated, which sometimes happens when people aren’t eating or drinking normally. The brief episode of confusion you mentioned earlier is something to keep an eye on, especially if it returns or worsens, as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances can occasionally cause this.

My main advice is to focus on hydration—small, frequent sips of water or clear fluids are best. Try to rest and avoid any foods that seem to worsen your symptoms. If you notice you’re unable to keep any fluids down, become very weak or dizzy, or if the confusion returns or gets worse, those are reasons to seek care promptly.

Let me ask—do you take any regular medications for your blood pressure or other conditions, and have you been able to take them as usual during this time?

**Patient**: Yes, I take lisinopril for my blood pressure and I've been able to keep taking it as usual. I also use insulin for my diabetes and have stayed on my regular medications.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 65-year-old female presenting with nausea, vomiting, and hypertension. Her symptoms began the night before admission with persistent nausea and inability to tolerate oral intake, progressing to vomiting and elevated blood glucose (up to 440 mg/dL) and systolic blood pressure in the 200s. She has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (on insulin pump), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and prior episodes of gastroparesis. On admission, she was found to have hyperglycemia with mild diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hypertensive crisis, but no evidence of end organ damage. The documented diagnoses were hyperglycemia and hypertensive crisis; her nausea and vomiting were attributed to gastroparesis. Treatment included intravenous fluids, antiemetics (IV and oral metoclopramide), aggressive insulin therapy (transitioned from pump to glargine and lispro), and antihypertensives (IV labetalol, later switched to oral labetalol, lisinopril, and clonidine patch). By discharge, her symptoms had resolved, blood pressure and glucose were controlled, and she was stable for discharge home with medication adjustments and follow-up arranged.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with persistent nausea and intermittent vomiting over the past two days as the chief complaint. Symptoms include difficulty keeping down food, mild dehydration (able to tolerate small amounts of water), and reduced ability to perform usual activities; vomiting typically occurs after eating or drinking. The patient denies fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or headache but reports elevated home blood pressure readings (150s/90s versus baseline 130s/80s) and a brief episode of confusion that has since improved. Relevant history includes hypertension managed with lisinopril and diabetes managed with insulin, both of which the patient has continued to take as usual. The clinical impression is a mild gastrointestinal upset, possibly viral or due to gastric irritation, with secondary mild dehydration and transiently elevated blood pressure. The treatment plan includes supportive care with small, frequent sips of clear fluids, avoidance of heavy foods, rest, and close monitoring for worsening symptoms such as inability to keep fluids down, persistent confusion, or further increases in blood pressure. The patient was advised to seek urgent care if these concerning symptoms develop.
