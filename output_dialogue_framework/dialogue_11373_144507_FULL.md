## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the pain, associated symptoms, and the context of recent stent placement. The patient responses are plausible and align with the documented symptoms and history. The doctor's reasoning is clear, cautious, and appropriately escalates care given the concerning symptom of syncope after a cardiac procedure. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The conversation is logical, respectful, and avoids role confusion.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any medications or clarify if they have already contacted their cardiologist.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates excellent clinical reasoning and communication. For completeness, the doctor could briefly address the patient's question about lower back pain and leg heaviness at the end.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is natural and logical. The summary and safety netting are well-placed. Consider a brief closing statement to reinforce next steps.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns; the doctor appropriately recommends urgent follow-up for post-procedure syncope. Clarity is high throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what's been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been having this steady, dull pain just behind my left shoulder blade, and it sort of spreads into my left shoulder and arm. It's been making me pretty uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long this discomfort has been going on—when did you first notice it?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly, but I think it started a few days ago, maybe around the time I had my stent placed.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what makes this pain change—does anything in particular seem to make it better or worse, like movement, deep breaths, or certain positions?

**Patient**: Moving my arm or shoulder doesn’t really change the pain much. I haven’t noticed deep breaths or changing positions making it better or worse either.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this discomfort, such as shortness of breath, sweating, or a feeling of pressure in your chest?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any shortness of breath, sweating, or chest pressure. The pain just stays around my left shoulder blade and sometimes into my left shoulder.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your left arm or hand since this started?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any numbness, tingling, or weakness in my arm or hand. It’s just the pain and discomfort.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your recent stent placement—have you had any follow-up or instructions about possible symptoms to watch for after the procedure?

**Patient**: After the stent, they told me to watch out for chest pain, shortness of breath, or anything unusual. I haven’t had chest pain, but I did feel lightheaded and actually passed out once while sitting in a chair. I’ve also noticed some mild lower back pain.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more question—how severe would you rate this discomfort on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever felt? And has it been staying about the same, or is it getting better or worse since it started?

**Patient**: I’d rate the pain around a 6 out of 10. It’s been pretty steady—hasn’t really gotten better or worse since it started.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your lightheadedness and the time you passed out—did that happen before or after your stent procedure, and did you notice anything specific leading up to it, like standing up quickly or feeling especially tired?

**Patient**: It happened after my stent procedure. I was just sitting in a chair when I got lightheaded and passed out—didn’t stand up quickly or feel especially tired before it happened.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, I want to walk you through my thinking. You’ve had a recent stent placement, and now you’re experiencing discomfort in your upper back and shoulder area, along with an episode of passing out while sitting. While your pain isn’t changing with movement or breathing, and you haven’t had chest pain or weakness, the fact that you fainted after a heart procedure makes me cautious.

Sometimes, discomfort in the upper back or shoulder can be related to muscle strain, nerve irritation, or even referred pain from the heart or nearby organs. Passing out unexpectedly, especially after a heart procedure, is something we take seriously because it could signal changes in blood flow, blood pressure, or heart rhythm.

Given your recent stent and these symptoms, I recommend you contact your cardiologist or go to the nearest emergency department today to be checked. Even though you don’t have chest pain, new fainting spells after a heart procedure need prompt evaluation to rule out any complications.

While many causes of upper back discomfort are benign, in your situation it’s important not to ignore these changes. If you notice new symptoms like chest pressure, severe shortness of breath, palpitations, or worsening pain, seek help right away. Would you like help arranging follow-up or have any questions about what I’ve explained?

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining everything so clearly. I understand why you’re concerned, and I agree—it’s better to be safe. I’ll reach out to my cardiologist right away. Do you think my lower back pain and the heaviness in both legs could be related, or should I mention those as well?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 56-year-old female presenting with left scapular pain. She described a dull, steady pain behind her left scapula radiating to her left shoulder and arm for two days, without associated shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis; the pain sometimes improved with neck movement or rubbing the arm. Her history is significant for coronary artery disease and recent right coronary artery stent placement four days prior. On initial evaluation, an electrocardiogram showed changes consistent with an inferior myocardial infarction, and she received sublingual nitroglycerin with some relief. Cardiac catheterization revealed total occlusion of the mid right coronary artery, which was treated with two stents. She had negative cardiac enzymes during her prior hospitalization and an uncomplicated recovery. The current episode involved recurrence of left subscapular pain following dinner, prompting her to contact her primary care provider. Further assessment and management were initiated due to concern for possible acute stent thrombosis.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with steady, dull pain behind the left shoulder blade radiating into the left shoulder and arm. The pain began a few days ago, around the time of a recent stent placement, is rated 6 out of 10 in severity, and has remained steady without change from movement, deep breaths, or position. The patient denied shortness of breath, sweating, chest pressure, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the arm or hand, but reported one episode of lightheadedness and fainting while sitting after the stent procedure, as well as mild lower back pain and heaviness in both legs. No specific medication allergies or other medical history were mentioned beyond the recent stent placement. On assessment, the doctor noted the absence of chest pain and neurological symptoms but expressed concern due to the combination of recent cardiac intervention and a fainting episode. The doctor advised that while upper back discomfort can have benign causes, new fainting after a stent procedure warrants prompt evaluation to rule out complications. The patient was instructed to contact their cardiologist or go to the emergency department for further assessment and to seek immediate help if new symptoms such as chest pressure, severe shortness of breath, palpitations, or worsening pain develop.
