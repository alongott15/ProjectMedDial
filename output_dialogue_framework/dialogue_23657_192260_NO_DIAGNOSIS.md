## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the onset, frequency, and characteristics of the vomiting, including the presence of blood, which matches the patient's symptoms and documented findings (maroon, occult-positive emesis). The advice to seek urgent care is appropriate given the risk of dehydration and GI bleeding, but does not escalate to ICU-level interventions. The conversation is plausible, clear, and avoids unsupported content or major errors.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and appropriately expresses understanding at the end. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any attempts at home remedies or describe the impact on diabetes management.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, they could briefly acknowledge the patient's underlying diabetes or gastroparesis as possible contributors to symptoms, since these are in the profile.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, moving from symptom history to assessment and plan. The closing summary and safety netting are well done.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The advice is appropriate for the scenario and includes clear warning signs.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hi there, what brings you in today? How have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been feeling pretty nauseous and throwing up a lot. That's mainly why I came in.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did these symptoms begin, and how often have you been vomiting?

**Patient**: I'm not totally sure when it started, but I've been vomiting pretty often—like a few times a day. The nausea's been there the whole time too.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something specific—have you noticed any blood in your vomit, or has it looked unusually dark, like coffee grounds or maroon in color?

**Patient**: Yeah, I've noticed my vomit looked kind of maroon, and they said it tested positive for blood.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you had any coughing recently, or issues with your throat or chest?

**Patient**: I've definitely been coughing some. My throat and chest feel okay otherwise, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. Are you able to keep down any food or fluids at all, or does everything seem to come back up?

**Patient**: Everything pretty much comes back up. I haven't really been able to keep food or drinks down.

**Doctor**: Got it. Has this made it difficult for you to go about your usual daily activities, like work or social plans? Are you feeling weak or lightheaded at all?

**Patient**: Yeah, it's definitely made things harder. I've felt pretty wiped out and haven't been able to do much.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall health—have you had any recent fevers, chills, or noticed any unusual bruising or bleeding elsewhere?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any fevers, chills, or noticed any unusual bruising or bleeding anywhere else.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has the vomiting and nausea been getting worse, staying about the same, or improving since it started?

**Patient**: It's been about the same, not really getting better or worse.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your ongoing nausea and frequent vomiting, along with the presence of blood in your vomit, are concerning features. The maroon color and positive blood test suggest there may be some irritation or bleeding in your upper digestive tract—sometimes this can happen from repeated vomiting, but it could also point to conditions like gastritis or, less commonly, an ulcer.

Not being able to keep food or fluids down for several days puts you at risk for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can make you feel weak and unable to do your usual activities.

At this point, it's important to get a better look at what's causing the bleeding and to help you rehydrate. I would recommend that you seek care in an urgent setting today, where they can check your blood counts, assess your hydration status, and possibly do further tests to find the source of bleeding. In the meantime, try to sip small amounts of clear fluids if you can tolerate them, but avoid solid foods until you've been evaluated.

If you notice black stools, severe abdominal pain, or feel faint when standing up, these are warning signs that need immediate attention. Does that plan make sense to you, or is there anything else you'd like to ask about what we've discussed?

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thanks for explaining it. I’ll head in and get checked out today. I appreciate you laying out what to watch for—if anything else comes up, I’ll let someone know right away.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 25-year-old male presenting with two days of nausea and one day of vomiting. Symptoms included vomiting described as initially yellowish green, later brown, with no frank blood and uncertain coffee-ground appearance; he also reported coughing but denied fever, chills, chest pain, or gastrointestinal bleeding. He has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus for eight years with multiple prior diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) admissions, gastroparesis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and depression; his last hemoglobin A1c was 10.1. Home medications included insulin 75/25, and he has allergies to penicillin and amoxicillin. On admission, his glucose was in the 400s with an elevated anion gap, and vital signs showed mild tachycardia (heart rate 105) and low-grade fever (99.5°F). The documented diagnosis was diabetic ketoacidosis. Treatment included hospitalization for DKA management, likely involving intravenous fluids, insulin therapy, and monitoring, though specific interventions are not detailed in the note.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with nausea and frequent vomiting as the chief complaint. Symptoms included persistent nausea and vomiting occurring several times daily, inability to keep down food or fluids, maroon-colored vomit that tested positive for blood, some coughing, and feeling weak and unable to perform usual activities; symptoms had remained stable without improvement or worsening. The patient denied fever, chills, unusual bruising, or bleeding elsewhere. No specific physical findings were noted beyond the patient's descriptions. The doctor assessed that ongoing nausea and vomiting with blood in the vomit suggested possible irritation or bleeding in the upper digestive tract, such as gastritis or, less commonly, an ulcer, and noted concern for dehydration and electrolyte imbalance due to inability to retain fluids. The doctor recommended urgent evaluation today for blood counts, hydration status, and further testing to identify the source of bleeding, advised sipping small amounts of clear fluids if tolerated, and avoiding solid foods until evaluated. The patient was instructed to seek immediate attention if black stools, severe abdominal pain, or faintness occurred.
