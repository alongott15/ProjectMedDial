## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, open-ended questions about the patient's gait changes, swelling, and impact on daily life. The patient responses are coherent and match the symptoms listed in the profile. The doctor's reasoning and advice are reasonable for a light case, with no unsupported diagnoses or interventions. There are no hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and appropriately expresses concerns. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any specific situations where unsteadiness was most noticeable or clarify if she uses any assistive devices.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For completeness, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's history of cerebral aneurysm, diabetes, hypertension, and COPD, and consider if these might contribute to symptoms, even if only to reassure or rule out acute concerns.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between topics. The conversation could be slightly improved by summarizing key points before giving advice or by inviting the patient to ask questions at the end.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns are present given the mild case context. The doctor appropriately advises on when to seek further care if symptoms worsen. Clarity is maintained throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been a bit concerned lately because I've noticed some changes in my walking. That's mainly why I wanted to come in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your walking—can you describe what feels different? For example, are you feeling unsteady, having trouble with balance, or noticing your feet don't move as smoothly as before?

**Patient**: Yes, I've been feeling a bit unsteady and my walking just feels off—like my balance isn’t quite what it used to be.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this is affecting your daily routine—are you finding it harder to do things like shopping, climbing stairs, or getting around your home?

**Patient**: Yes, it's definitely made things like getting around my house and going up stairs more challenging. I feel like I have to be extra careful not to lose my balance.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed these changes—how long has your walking felt off or unsteady?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it began, but I think it's been going on for a little while now—maybe a few weeks.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the changes in your walking, such as numbness, tingling, weakness in your legs, or any recent falls?

**Patient**: I haven't had any numbness or tingling, and I don't think I've had any weakness in my legs. I did notice some mild swelling in my left foot, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you walk, do you ever feel like you might actually lose your balance or fall, or is it more of a mild unsteadiness? Also, does the swelling in your left foot seem to get better with rest or when you elevate it?

**Patient**: I do sometimes feel like I might lose my balance, especially if I’m not paying close attention. The swelling in my left foot does seem to go down a bit when I put my feet up.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about how this is affecting your day-to-day life—are there any activities you've had to avoid or change because of the way you're walking lately?

**Patient**: I've had to cut back on things like walking for exercise and doing chores around the house. I just don't feel as steady, so I'm trying to be more careful.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how things have changed over time. Has your walking or sense of balance been getting better, worse, or staying about the same over these past few weeks?

**Patient**: It's been staying about the same these past few weeks—not really better, but not getting worse either.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your unsteady walking and mild swelling in your left foot have been present for a few weeks and seem to be affecting your daily activities, but aren't getting worse. Often, changes in balance and gait in someone your age can be related to a variety of common causes, such as minor joint issues, muscle weakness, or even mild swelling that makes it harder to walk steadily. Since the swelling improves when you elevate your foot, it may be related to circulation or fluid buildup, which can sometimes happen with age or after standing for long periods.

It's reassuring that you haven't noticed numbness, tingling, or leg weakness, and that you haven't had any falls. At this stage, I recommend continuing to be cautious at home—using handrails on stairs, keeping pathways clear, and wearing supportive footwear. Elevating your feet when sitting can help with swelling. If you notice any new symptoms like sudden weakness, numbness, or if your balance worsens, let me know right away.

Would you like advice on simple balance exercises or ways to make your home safer while you're feeling this way?

**Patient**: That makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I’d appreciate any advice you have about balance exercises or making my home safer.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 65-year-old woman presenting with a cerebral aneurysm. She reported no headache, vision problems, weakness, or paresthesias, but did note changes in her gait. Her past medical history includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; she is allergic to penicillin, Keflex, and Bactrim. On physical exam, she was frail but in no acute distress, with positive rales in the chest and an ataxic gait. The documented diagnosis was cerebral aneurysm. She underwent successful coiling of the aneurysm and remained neurologically stable postoperatively. Post-procedure care included hourly neurological checks and heparin to maintain her PTT in the 50-60 range. She was discharged in stable condition.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with concerns about changes in walking, specifically feeling unsteady and having decreased balance for the past few weeks. Symptoms included mild unsteadiness, increased difficulty with daily activities such as getting around the house, climbing stairs, and walking for exercise, as well as mild swelling in the left foot that improves with elevation. The patient denied numbness, tingling, leg weakness, or recent falls, and reported that symptoms have remained stable without worsening. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. On assessment, the doctor noted unsteady gait and mild left foot swelling, with no neurological deficits reported. The doctor attributed the symptoms to possible minor joint issues, muscle weakness, or mild swelling related to circulation or fluid buildup. The treatment plan included advice to be cautious at home (using handrails, keeping pathways clear, wearing supportive footwear), elevating the feet to reduce swelling, and monitoring for new symptoms such as sudden weakness or worsening balance. The doctor also offered to provide guidance on balance exercises and home safety modifications.
