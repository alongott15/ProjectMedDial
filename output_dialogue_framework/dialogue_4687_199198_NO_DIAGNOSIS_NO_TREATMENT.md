## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the injury, symptoms, and possible complications, and provides clear, evidence-based advice for a mild facial injury. The patient responds plausibly and consistently with the described symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events introduced. The conversation is thorough but not repetitive, and both parties maintain their roles appropriately.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could mention any other minor symptoms (e.g., headache, anxiety) if present, but overall the responses are appropriate.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor provides excellent reassurance and clear instructions. For improvement, could briefly confirm no other injuries (e.g., thumb laceration) are causing concern, as per the profile, but this is a minor omission.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between assessment, advice, and reassurance. The conversation could be slightly shorter by consolidating some repeated advice at the end.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety is well addressed with clear instructions on warning signs and when to seek further care. Clarity is excellent throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask—what brings you in today? What’s been bothering you the most?

**Patient**: I was hit by a car while walking, and since then, my right eye area has been a bit sore. That’s what’s bothering me most right now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the soreness—when did you first notice the pain around your eye? Was it right after the accident, or did it develop later?

**Patient**: It was right after the accident—I noticed the pain in my right eye area pretty much immediately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any changes to your vision or any swelling or bruising around the eye since the accident?

**Patient**: I haven’t noticed any changes to my vision. There’s been a bit of blood coming from my right nostril since it happened, though.

**Doctor**: Okay. How much blood have you noticed from your nostril—just a small amount, or has it been more significant? And is it still happening now, or has it stopped?

**Patient**: It was just a small amount of blood, nothing heavy. I don’t see any more bleeding now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discomfort—can you point to exactly where the pain is around your eye? Is it more on the eyelid, the bone above or below the eye, or somewhere else?

**Patient**: The pain is mostly on the bone just under my right eye. It’s not really on the eyelid itself.

**Doctor**: Alright. How would you rate the soreness under your eye right now—would you describe it as mild, moderate, or more severe? And is it getting better, staying the same, or getting worse since the accident?

**Patient**: I’d call the soreness mild right now. It hasn’t really gotten worse or better since the accident—it’s just stayed about the same.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since the soreness has stayed mild, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your cheek or upper lip on that side? Sometimes a bruise or mild injury in this area can affect the nearby nerves, so I want to check for that.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any numbness or tingling in my cheek or upper lip. It’s just that mild soreness under my right eye.

**Doctor**: Alright. Since you haven’t had any vision changes or significant bleeding, and the soreness is mild and stable, this sounds like a minor bruise to the bone under your eye—something that’s common after a small facial injury. It’s good you’re not having numbness or tingling, which suggests there’s no nerve involvement.

Most of the time, mild soreness like this improves gradually over several days. You can use a cool compress on the area for short periods to help with swelling or discomfort. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen can also help if needed, as long as you don’t have any allergies or other reasons to avoid them.

If you notice any new symptoms—such as worsening pain, swelling that increases, changes in your vision, double vision, or any numbness—those would be reasons to get checked more urgently. For now, gentle care and observation should be enough.

Does that all make sense, or is there anything else about the injury you’re concerned about?

**Patient**: That makes sense, thank you for explaining it so clearly. I’ll try the cool compress and keep an eye on things. If anything changes, I’ll let someone know.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, it sounds like you experienced a minor injury to the bone under your right eye after the accident. Since your discomfort is mild, stable, and you haven’t noticed any vision changes, numbness, or ongoing bleeding, this suggests there’s no serious damage like a fracture or nerve injury. Mild soreness and a small nosebleed can happen from the impact, and usually resolve with time and gentle care.

What I’d recommend is continuing with cool compresses for short periods to help with any swelling, and using over-the-counter pain relief if needed. It’s important to watch for new symptoms—such as increased pain, changes in your vision, significant swelling, or numbness—which could indicate something more than a simple bruise.

Most people recover well from this kind of injury within a week or two. If anything changes or you become concerned, don’t hesitate to seek further evaluation. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there’s anything else you’re worried about regarding your recovery.

**Patient**: Thanks, that all sounds clear. I feel better knowing it’s likely just a bruise and nothing more serious. I’ll keep an eye out for any new symptoms like you mentioned.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, your symptoms are most consistent with a mild bruise to the area just under your right eye, likely from the impact when you were hit. The fact that your vision is unchanged, there’s no ongoing bleeding, and you haven’t developed numbness or tingling is reassuring and suggests there’s no serious injury to the eye or nearby nerves.

In these situations, the main concern is to monitor for any changes—such as increasing pain, swelling, new vision problems, or numbness—which could indicate a more significant injury like a fracture. Since your symptoms have stayed mild and stable, it’s reasonable to continue gentle care at home.

You’re doing the right thing by watching for any new or worsening symptoms. Most minor bruises like this improve within a week or two. If anything changes or you start to feel worse, it would be important to get checked again. Otherwise, rest and self-care should help with your recovery.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining everything. I feel a bit more at ease now knowing it’s just a mild bruise. I’ll keep an eye out for any changes like you suggested.

**Doctor**: Let me share my thoughts on what you’ve described. When someone experiences a direct impact to the area under the eye, it’s common to have some soreness and mild swelling, as the bone there is close to the surface and can bruise easily. The absence of vision changes or ongoing bleeding, and the fact that you haven’t noticed any numbness or tingling, makes a more serious injury like a fracture or nerve involvement much less likely.

What I’d suggest is continuing with gentle home care—using cool compresses to reduce any swelling and taking over-the-counter pain relief if you need it. Most minor bruises in this area improve within a week or two. It’s important to monitor for any new symptoms, such as vision changes, significant swelling, or numbness, as these could indicate a need for further evaluation.

If everything stays the same or improves, you can expect a gradual recovery. If anything changes, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other concerns on your mind?

**Patient**: That all sounds clear, thank you. I don’t have any other concerns right now. I’ll follow your advice and let you know if anything changes.

## EHR Summary

The patient is an 86-year-old male presenting after being struck by a car traveling at approximately 20–25 mph, with the main complaint of mild right orbital pain. He denied loss of consciousness but could not recall all events surrounding the impact; he was alert and responsive at the scene with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15. On examination, he had a right supraorbital laceration (3–3.5 cm), blood from the right nare, and a small left thumb laceration, but was otherwise in no apparent distress with stable vital signs. Past medical history is significant for hypertension; there are no known drug allergies. Imaging revealed a left temporoparietal epidural versus subdural bleed and a left occipital parenchymal bleed, with no fractures identified on chest, pelvis, or cervical spine imaging. The documented clinical impression was acute head injury with associated minor soft tissue injuries. He was admitted to the ICU for close neurological monitoring, evaluated by Neurosurgery and Ophthalmology, and subsequently deemed stable for discharge. Discharge recommendations included outpatient follow-up with Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology, and his primary care physician.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with soreness under the right eye following a pedestrian-versus-car accident. The pain began immediately after the incident, is localized to the bone just below the right eye, and is described as mild and stable without progression. The patient denies vision changes, numbness, tingling, or significant swelling, and reports only a small amount of self-limited right-sided nasal bleeding after the accident. There is no history of ongoing bleeding or neurological symptoms.

The documented clinical impression is a mild bruise (contusion) to the bone under the right eye, with no evidence of fracture, nerve injury, or ocular involvement. The treatment plan includes gentle home care with cool compresses for swelling and over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen if needed. The patient was advised to monitor for new symptoms including increased pain, swelling, vision changes, or numbness, which would warrant urgent reassessment. Most minor bruises are expected to resolve within one to two weeks with conservative management.
