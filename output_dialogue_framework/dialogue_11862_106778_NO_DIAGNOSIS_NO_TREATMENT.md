## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the pain, swelling, and changes in the bruise, and the patient provides plausible answers. The doctor's reasoning and advice are appropriate for a mild case of cellulitis/hematoma without systemic symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The conversation is clear, logical, and stays within the bounds of a light, common case.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient's responses are clear and relevant. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any recent trauma or injury if prompted, or clarify if they have had similar issues before.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor provides good education and safety-netting. For completeness, the doctor could briefly mention the patient's history of heart disease or anticoagulation (if relevant) as a risk factor for hematoma, but it's not required for this mild scenario.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural. The conversation transitions smoothly from symptom exploration to advice and safety-netting.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The doctor gives clear instructions on when to seek further care and how to manage symptoms at home. No safety concerns are present.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some pain in my left leg, right where the bruise is. That's really what's been bothering me lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your pain—does anything seem to make it better or worse, like walking or resting?

**Patient**: Resting helps some, but walking or moving around makes the pain worse in my leg.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any changes you've noticed—has the bruise itself gotten larger or changed color recently?

**Patient**: Yes, the bruise on my left shin seems to have gotten a bit bigger, and there’s some redness around it now. The color has changed a little too.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any swelling, warmth, or drainage from the area around the bruise?

**Patient**: There's definitely some swelling and the area feels warm. I haven't noticed any drainage, though.

**Doctor**: Alright. When did you first notice the pain and the bruise—has it been days or weeks?

**Patient**: I first noticed the pain and bruise a few days ago. It hasn’t been that long, but it feels like it’s getting worse.

**Doctor**: Got it. How would you rate your pain right now on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine?

**Patient**: Right now, I’d rate the pain around a 7 out of 10. It’s pretty uncomfortable, especially when I try to move around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your general health—have you had any fever, chills, or felt generally unwell since this started?

**Patient**: I haven't had any fever or chills, and I don't really feel unwell overall. It's just the pain and swelling in my leg that's bothering me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your mobility—are you able to walk normally, or has the swelling and discomfort made it difficult to get around your home?

**Patient**: It's been tough to get around my home. The pain and swelling in my left leg make it hard to walk normally.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you have a bruise on your left shin that has gotten larger and more red, with swelling and warmth, and it's making it hard to walk. These changes can sometimes happen after an injury, but increasing size, redness, and warmth may also suggest some irritation or even infection in the tissue under the skin.

While you haven't had fever or chills, it's important to keep an eye on these symptoms. If the redness continues to spread, you develop a fever, or notice pus or drainage, those can be warning signs that need prompt attention.

For now, resting the leg, keeping it elevated when possible, and applying a cool compress may help with swelling. Avoid putting too much weight on it. If things get worse or you notice new symptoms, please reach out to your healthcare provider.

Let me know if you have questions or concerns about what to watch for, or if you'd like advice about home care for bruising and swelling.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining everything. I’ll keep an eye on the redness and swelling like you said. If I notice any drainage or if things get worse, I’ll reach out. The pain is pretty bothersome right now, but I’ll try resting and elevating my leg.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 69-year-old male presenting with left lower extremity cellulitis and hematoma following trauma to his left shin six days prior to admission. He reported progressive swelling and pain at the hematoma site, with surrounding erythema and edema, but denied fever, chills, distal weakness, or sensory deficits. His past medical history includes congestive heart failure (CHF) with EF 35%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, status post aortic valve replacement, and other comorbidities; he is allergic to penicillin (rash) and morphine (paranoia). On admission, his INR was supratherapeutic at 4.4, and he had been on oral Keflex for four days without improvement. The documented diagnoses were left lower extremity hematoma, left leg cellulitis, CHF, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. Treatment included holding and then restarting Coumadin, IV Ancef followed by oral Keflex for a total of 7 days, surgical evacuation of the hematoma, wound care with pressure dressings, and continuation of his cardiac medications. He was discharged home with plans for wound care via VNA and follow-up with his primary care physician and surgery clinic.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with pain in the left leg at the site of a bruise. The pain began a few days ago, is rated 7 out of 10 in severity, worsens with walking or movement, and improves somewhat with rest. The patient reports that the bruise has increased in size, changed color, and is now associated with redness, swelling, and warmth, but denies fever, chills, drainage, or feeling generally unwell. The swelling and discomfort are significant enough to make walking at home difficult. There is no documented relevant medical history, medications, or allergies. The clinical impression is a bruised left shin with signs of possible irritation or early infection (such as increasing redness, swelling, and warmth), though no definitive diagnosis of infection was made. The treatment plan includes rest, leg elevation, application of a cool compress, minimizing weight-bearing, and monitoring for worsening symptoms such as spreading redness, fever, or drainage, with instructions to seek prompt medical attention if these occur.
