## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the pain, swelling, and changes in the bruise, and the patient provides plausible answers. The doctor's reasoning and advice are appropriate for a mild case of cellulitis/hematoma without systemic symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The conversation is clear, logical, and stays within the bounds of a light, common case.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient's responses are clear and relevant. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any recent trauma or injury if prompted, or clarify if they have had similar issues before.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor provides good education and safety-netting. For completeness, the doctor could briefly mention the patient's history of heart disease or anticoagulation (if relevant) as a risk factor for hematoma, but it's not required for this mild scenario.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural. The conversation transitions smoothly from symptom exploration to advice and safety-netting.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The doctor gives clear instructions on when to seek further care and how to manage symptoms at home. No safety concerns are present.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some pain in my left leg, right where the bruise is. That's really what's been bothering me lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your pain—does anything seem to make it better or worse, like walking or resting?

**Patient**: Resting helps some, but walking or moving around makes the pain worse in my leg.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any changes you've noticed—has the bruise itself gotten larger or changed color recently?

**Patient**: Yes, the bruise on my left shin seems to have gotten a bit bigger, and there’s some redness around it now. The color has changed a little too.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any swelling, warmth, or drainage from the area around the bruise?

**Patient**: There's definitely some swelling and the area feels warm. I haven't noticed any drainage, though.

**Doctor**: Alright. When did you first notice the pain and the bruise—has it been days or weeks?

**Patient**: I first noticed the pain and bruise a few days ago. It hasn’t been that long, but it feels like it’s getting worse.

**Doctor**: Got it. How would you rate your pain right now on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine?

**Patient**: Right now, I’d rate the pain around a 7 out of 10. It’s pretty uncomfortable, especially when I try to move around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your general health—have you had any fever, chills, or felt generally unwell since this started?

**Patient**: I haven't had any fever or chills, and I don't really feel unwell overall. It's just the pain and swelling in my leg that's bothering me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your mobility—are you able to walk normally, or has the swelling and discomfort made it difficult to get around your home?

**Patient**: It's been tough to get around my home. The pain and swelling in my left leg make it hard to walk normally.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you have a bruise on your left shin that has gotten larger and more red, with swelling and warmth, and it's making it hard to walk. These changes can sometimes happen after an injury, but increasing size, redness, and warmth may also suggest some irritation or even infection in the tissue under the skin.

While you haven't had fever or chills, it's important to keep an eye on these symptoms. If the redness continues to spread, you develop a fever, or notice pus or drainage, those can be warning signs that need prompt attention.

For now, resting the leg, keeping it elevated when possible, and applying a cool compress may help with swelling. Avoid putting too much weight on it. If things get worse or you notice new symptoms, please reach out to your healthcare provider.

Let me know if you have questions or concerns about what to watch for, or if you'd like advice about home care for bruising and swelling.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining everything. I’ll keep an eye on the redness and swelling like you said. If I notice any drainage or if things get worse, I’ll reach out. The pain is pretty bothersome right now, but I’ll try resting and elevating my leg.

His past medical history includes congestive heart failure (CHF) with ejection fraction of 35%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease status post CABG, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea on BiPAP, and prior aortic valve replacement. On presentation, his INR was recently supratherapeutic but his vital signs were stable and he was afebrile. Physical exam findings are not detailed in the note. The documented diagnosis was left lower extremity cellulitis with associated hematoma. Treatment included initiation of IV Ancef after obtaining blood cultures, following prior outpatient therapy with oral Keflex and pain management with Vicodin.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with pain in the left leg at the site of a bruise. The pain began a few days ago, is rated 7 out of 10 in severity, worsens with walking or movement, and improves somewhat with rest. The patient reported that the bruise on the left shin has increased in size, changed color, developed surrounding redness, and is associated with swelling and warmth; no drainage was noted. There is no history of fever, chills, or general malaise, but the swelling and discomfort have made it difficult for the patient to walk normally at home. The doctor noted the increasing size, redness, and warmth of the bruise and explained these could indicate irritation or possible infection of the tissue under the skin. The doctor advised resting the leg, keeping it elevated, applying a cool compress for swelling, and avoiding excessive weight-bearing. The patient was instructed to monitor for spreading redness, fever, or drainage and to seek prompt medical attention if these symptoms develop.
