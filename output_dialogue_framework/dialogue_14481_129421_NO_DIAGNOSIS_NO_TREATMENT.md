## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, open-ended questions about symptoms related to carotid stenosis and associated findings (mild right lower extremity weakness, trace pedal edema), and the patient responses are plausible and consistent. The doctor provides clear, reassuring explanations and appropriate safety-netting advice without introducing unsupported diagnoses or treatments. There are no hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and appropriately expresses concern about their diagnosis. For even greater realism, the patient could occasionally express uncertainty or ask a clarifying question.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. To further enhance realism, the doctor could briefly mention the importance of diabetes and hypertension management in the context of carotid disease, as these are in the profile.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between topics. The conversation could be slightly more concise in places, but overall it maintains a realistic pace.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety-netting is clear and appropriate. The doctor avoids unnecessary alarm and provides actionable advice. No safety or clarity concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome! How have you been feeling lately, and is there anything in particular that’s been on your mind regarding your health?

**Patient**: Lately, I’ve been thinking about my left carotid stenosis. My doctor mentioned it, and I haven’t had any symptoms, but it’s still on my mind.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this has been affecting you—are you finding that concerns about your carotid artery are impacting your day-to-day life or causing you any particular worries?

**Patient**: No, it hasn’t really changed my daily routine. I just find myself thinking about it sometimes, since it was brought up at my last appointment.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something related—have you ever noticed any weakness, numbness, or trouble speaking, even briefly? Sometimes people with carotid narrowing can experience these, but it’s also common to have no symptoms at all.

**Patient**: I haven’t had any trouble speaking or numbness. I do have some mild weakness in my right lower leg, but it's not too bothersome.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your right leg—when did you first notice this mild weakness, and has it changed over time?

**Patient**: I first noticed the mild weakness in my right leg a little while back, but I can't remember exactly when. It hasn't really gotten any worse over time.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something else your doctor may have mentioned—have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles, even if it's just a little? This can sometimes be related to circulation and is good to keep track of.

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve noticed a little bit of swelling in my feet—just trace pedal edema. It hasn’t been too noticeable, but it’s there.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to walk or do your usual activities since the swelling started, or does it seem to stay about the same throughout the day?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any changes in my ability to walk or do things around the house. The swelling seems to stay about the same throughout the day.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you mentioned the mild weakness in your leg, does anything seem to trigger it or make it more noticeable, like walking longer distances or standing for a while?

**Patient**: No, walking or standing doesn’t seem to make the weakness in my right leg any worse. It just stays about the same most of the time.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about how noticeable the weakness is—does it make certain movements, like climbing stairs or getting up from a chair, more difficult, or is it only something you notice if you pay close attention?

**Patient**: I only notice the weakness in my right leg if I’m paying close attention. It doesn’t really make it harder to climb stairs or get up from a chair.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your carotid artery narrowing hasn’t caused any clear symptoms, and the mild changes you’ve noticed haven’t affected your daily life or activities. Often, carotid stenosis is found before it causes problems, and many people never develop symptoms. The mild swelling in your feet is also common and, since it hasn’t progressed or limited you, it’s not worrisome at this stage.

It’s good to stay aware of any sudden changes—such as difficulty speaking, new numbness, or vision changes—since these could be warning signs to get checked out right away. Otherwise, keeping up with regular check-ins with your doctor and managing general health factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, and staying active are the best steps.

If you ever notice new or worsening symptoms, let your healthcare provider know promptly. For now, it sounds like things are stable, and that’s reassuring. Is there anything else about your health that’s been on your mind?

**Patient**: Thanks, that’s helpful to hear. I’ll keep an eye out for any sudden changes like you mentioned. Right now, I don’t have anything else on my mind, but I appreciate your guidance.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a male over 90 years old presenting with asymptomatic left carotid stenosis. He did not report any symptoms, and physical examination revealed he was in good health with no acute distress, though bilateral carotid bruits and mild right lower extremity weakness were noted. His past medical history includes type 2 diabetes for 30 years and hypertension; he has no known allergies. The documented diagnosis was asymptomatic left carotid stenosis. He was admitted for attempted carotid stenting, which was unsuccessful due to a calcified and highly tortuous aortic arch. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was restarted on Coumadin 4 mg daily, with an INR of 2.1 at discharge, and continued atorvastatin 20 mg daily. He was advised to have his INR checked after discharge and to follow up with his primary care doctor. At discharge, he was in stable condition.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting for follow-up regarding known left carotid stenosis. They report no symptoms attributable to carotid disease, such as speech difficulty or numbness, but do note mild, stable weakness in the right lower leg that is only noticeable with close attention and does not impact daily activities. The patient also describes trace pedal edema (mild swelling in the feet) that has not progressed or affected function. There is no history of symptom progression, triggers, or limitations in mobility. Relevant history includes left carotid artery narrowing; no other medical history, medications, or allergies are specified. The clinical impression is asymptomatic left carotid stenosis with mild, non-progressive right leg weakness and trace pedal edema. The treatment plan includes monitoring for new or worsening neurological symptoms (such as speech difficulty, numbness, or vision changes), maintaining regular follow-up, and managing general health factors like blood pressure, cholesterol, and physical activity. No immediate interventions are recommended at this time.
