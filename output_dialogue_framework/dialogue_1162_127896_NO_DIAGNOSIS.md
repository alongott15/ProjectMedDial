## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and symptoms. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the headache, balance, and associated symptoms, and summarizes findings accurately. The explanation and advice are reasonable for a light case, and the patient responds in a realistic manner. There are no unsupported diagnoses or treatments, and the conversation avoids introducing new, unrelated information.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and describes symptoms well. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any self-care measures already tried or express concerns about the brain tumor diagnosis, given the context.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and reassurance. For completeness, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's known brain tumor and clarify if these symptoms are being monitored by neurosurgery, or if this is a new/worsening presentation.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate follow-up questions and summary. The closing is collaborative. Consider a brief check for medication use or other comorbidities (e.g., diabetes) for completeness.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The safety netting is appropriate for a light case. However, given the patient's history of a brain tumor, it would be prudent for the doctor to explicitly state that if there are any new or worsening neurological symptoms, urgent evaluation is needed. This would reinforce clarity and safety.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in today

**Patient**: Thanks. I’m here because I’ve been having these headaches that start in the middle of my forehead and go to the back of my head.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how much these headaches are affecting your day-to-day life. Are they making it hard for you to work, concentrate, or do your usual activities?

**Patient**: They definitely make it harder to focus, and I’ve been a lot more careful moving around since my balance isn’t great lately. I’m still able to do most things, but it’s taking more effort.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the quality of the pain—does it feel more like a tight pressure, a throbbing sensation, or something else? Also, have you noticed if anything in particular seems to trigger or worsen these headaches?

**Patient**: It feels more like a tight, pulsing pressure than throbbing. I haven’t noticed any clear triggers—it just sort of comes on and sticks around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your balance—have you had any episodes where you actually lost your balance or felt like the room was spinning? Or is it more a general sense of unsteadiness?

**Patient**: I haven’t actually fallen, but it’s more of a constant unsteady feeling. I do get dizzy sometimes, but the room doesn’t spin.

**Doctor**: Got it. How long have these headaches and the unsteady feeling been going on—are we talking days, weeks, or longer?

**Patient**: I've had these headaches and the unsteady feeling for at least a few weeks now. It's been a pretty steady issue during that time.

**Doctor**: Alright. In the past few weeks, has the sensation of unsteadiness or the pressure feeling changed at all—has it been getting worse, staying about the same, or improving?

**Patient**: It’s mostly stayed the same over the past few weeks—hasn’t really gotten better or worse. The pressure and unsteadiness are pretty constant.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any additional symptoms—have you noticed any vision changes, weakness, numbness, or trouble speaking along with these headaches and balance issues?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any vision changes, weakness, numbness, or trouble speaking. It’s really just the headaches, the tightness that kind of pulses, my poor balance, dizziness, and some pressure in my right ear.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you mentioned a sense of pressure in your right ear, have you had any recent congestion, sinus issues, or changes in hearing—like fullness, ringing, or muffled sounds? Sometimes ear or sinus problems can contribute to these kinds of sensations.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any congestion, sinus issues, or changes in my hearing. It’s just the pressure feeling in my right ear, nothing else unusual with it.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re dealing with a steady, pressure-like headache with some dizziness and a sense of unsteadiness, along with ear pressure—but without other concerning symptoms like vision changes, weakness, or speech problems. What often happens in cases like this is that tension-type headaches can cause a tight, band-like pressure and sometimes make people feel off-balance or dizzy, especially if the muscles around the head and neck are tense.

The ear pressure could also be contributing to your sense of imbalance, even if there’s no congestion or hearing change. Since your symptoms have been stable and haven’t worsened, and you’re not having any red-flag symptoms, this is reassuring.

For now, I’d suggest focusing on gentle neck stretches, staying hydrated, managing stress, and getting regular sleep—these often help with tension-type headaches. If you notice new symptoms like double vision, severe or sudden headache, weakness, or if things get worse, it’s important to seek care promptly. Otherwise, we can monitor how things go over the next week or two. Does this approach sound reasonable to you?

**Patient**: That sounds reasonable, thanks for explaining it. I’ll try the stretches and keep track of the symptoms—especially the dizziness and the headaches that go from my forehead to the back of my head. If anything changes, I’ll let you know.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 53-year-old man presenting for evaluation of a brain tumor. He initially experienced pulsatile tightness, poor balance, dizziness, and later developed mid-frontal headaches radiating to the back of his head, along with right ear pressure; these symptoms were not relieved by antibiotics or physical therapy. His past medical history includes insulin-dependent diabetes, angina, and prior angioplasty with three stent placements. MRI revealed a right temporal brain mass, and he subsequently underwent a right temporal craniotomy for tumor resection. The documented diagnosis is brain tumor (right temporal lobe). Postoperatively, his neurological exam was stable and unremarkable except for mild left iliopsoas weakness and absent ankle jerks. Treatment included Depakote 500 mg orally three times daily for one week, Decadron tapered to 2 mg twice daily over 1-2 weeks, Zantac, Percocet as needed, and continuation of his home medications. He was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled in the brain tumor clinic.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with headaches that begin in the middle of the forehead and radiate to the back of the head as the chief complaint. The headaches have a tight, pulsing pressure quality and have persisted steadily for several weeks, accompanied by difficulty concentrating, a constant sense of unsteadiness, occasional dizziness (without vertigo), and a sensation of pressure in the right ear. There are no associated vision changes, weakness, numbness, speech difficulties, congestion, sinus issues, or hearing changes. Relevant history regarding past medical conditions, medications, or allergies is not specified.

The clinical impression is tension-type headache with associated dizziness and imbalance, possibly exacerbated by ear pressure. The treatment plan includes gentle neck stretches, hydration, stress management, and regular sleep. The patient was advised to monitor for new or worsening symptoms such as double vision, severe or sudden headache, or neurological deficits, and to seek prompt care if these occur. Otherwise, symptoms will be monitored over the next week or two.
