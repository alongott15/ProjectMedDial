## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the hematoma, bleeding, chest discomfort, and associated symptoms. The patient responses are coherent and match the clinical scenario. The doctor's reasoning is sound, summarizing findings and recommending urgent evaluation, which is appropriate given the context of a growing hematoma and hypotension after cardiac catheterization. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or hallucinations are present.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses concerns appropriately. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any medications (e.g., blood thinners) if prompted, or express more anxiety or questions about the situation.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly check for other bleeding symptoms (e.g., gum/nosebleeds, black stools) or clarify medication use, but this is not essential given the focus.

**Conversation Flow**: The conversation flows logically from symptom history to assessment and advice. The summary and safety netting are clear and appropriate.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and urgent, matching the scenario. The doctor appropriately emphasizes warning signs and immediate action. No clarity issues detected.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me about any concerns or symptoms you’ve been having lately?

**Patient**: I've been having this growing bruise and some bleeding near my right groin where they did the heart procedure. It's making me a bit anxious.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed the bruise and bleeding—did it start right after your procedure, or has it developed more recently?

**Patient**: It started not long after the procedure, I think. The bruising and the oozing just seem to be getting worse.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any chest discomfort or pain, especially when you’re at rest?

**Patient**: Yes, I've had some chest discomfort and pain even when I'm just sitting still. It comes and goes.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your breathing—have you noticed any shortness of breath, especially when walking or moving around?

**Patient**: Yes, I do get short of breath when I'm moving around. It's been harder than usual to catch my breath.

**Doctor**: Alright. How would you describe the severity of your chest discomfort—would you say it’s mild, moderate, or quite severe? And does anything in particular seem to trigger or relieve it?

**Patient**: It's more on the moderate side, not the worst I've ever had but definitely uncomfortable. I haven't noticed anything in particular that makes it better or worse, it just comes and goes.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about the bruise itself—has it been getting larger or changing color, and is the area around it swollen, firm, or especially tender to touch?

**Patient**: Yes, the bruise has definitely been getting bigger and changing color. The area is swollen, feels pretty firm, and it's tender when I touch it. There's also still some oozing from the spot.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you've had a heart procedure recently, have you noticed any lightheadedness, dizziness, or feeling faint along with these symptoms?

**Patient**: Yes, I've felt a bit lightheaded, especially when I stand up. The oozing from my groin hasn't really stopped either, and the bruising keeps spreading.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about any signs of infection—have you noticed any warmth, redness spreading from the area, or fever since this started?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any fever or spreading redness. The area is bruised and swollen, but it doesn't feel especially warm.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like the area where your heart procedure was done is showing signs of a growing bruise with ongoing oozing, swelling, and firmness. Along with that, you're experiencing chest discomfort at rest, shortness of breath with activity, and some lightheadedness when standing. These symptoms suggest that there could be ongoing bleeding or a collection of blood (a hematoma) at the procedure site, which can sometimes put pressure on nearby structures or even affect your blood volume.

The fact that the bruising is spreading and the oozing hasn't stopped is concerning after a heart procedure, especially combined with your chest symptoms and lightheadedness. While you haven’t noticed signs of infection like fever or redness, your symptoms could indicate a complication that needs prompt attention.

Given all this, I strongly recommend you seek immediate medical evaluation—ideally, return to the hospital or call emergency services. They can check for significant bleeding, monitor your heart, and make sure you’re safe. At home, try to keep pressure on the area and avoid standing up quickly or walking around until you’re seen.

If you notice worsening chest pain, severe shortness of breath, sudden weakness, or if you feel faint or collapse, these are urgent warning signs. Please don’t wait to get help in those situations.

Do you have someone with you who can help you get to care quickly?

**Patient**: My daughter is here with me, so she can help get me to the hospital. Thank you for explaining everything—I’ll make sure we go right away.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 78-year-old woman presenting with complications following a diagnostic cardiac catheterization. She has a history of coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and COPD, and reports longstanding angina at rest and dyspnea on exertion, with recent increased frequency of chest discomfort lasting about 10 minutes and mild exertional dyspnea. Her prior cardiac history includes a 90% ostial lesion and a 99% mid-RCA lesion treated with PTCA in 2190, and a recent Persantine Myoview scan showed a small reversible anteroapical defect with normal LV function (EF 76%). During the current admission, her cardiac catheterization revealed no change in coronary disease, but was complicated by a growing right groin hematoma and hypotension post-procedure. Onset of hypotension and bradycardia was managed with manual pressure, a clamp, 1 mg atropine for bradycardia, and transient dopamine support. The documented clinical impression is post-cardiac catheterization hematoma with associated hypotension. Treatment included hemostasis by manual pressure and supportive care for hemodynamic instability.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with a growing bruise and ongoing bleeding near the right groin following a recent heart procedure. Symptoms included worsening bruising that is enlarging and changing color, persistent oozing from the site, swelling, firmness, and tenderness to touch. The patient also reported moderate chest discomfort at rest that comes and goes, shortness of breath with activity, and lightheadedness when standing; no fever or spreading redness was noted. Relevant history includes a recent heart procedure; no medications or allergies were mentioned. On assessment, the doctor noted concern for ongoing bleeding or a hematoma at the procedure site, possibly affecting blood volume or causing pressure on nearby structures, and highlighted the absence of infection signs. The doctor strongly recommended immediate medical evaluation at the hospital to assess for significant bleeding and monitor cardiac status. The patient was advised to keep pressure on the area, avoid sudden standing or walking, and seek emergency care if symptoms worsen. The patient confirmed understanding and arranged for prompt transport to the hospital.
