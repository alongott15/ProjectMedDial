## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the shoulder weakness, explores associated symptoms, and connects the history of delirium (resolving) with the current complaint. The reasoning is cautious and avoids unsupported diagnoses or interventions. The patient responses are clear and relevant. There are no obvious hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers. For even greater realism, the patient could offer more detail about daily activities or express concerns about possible causes.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's underlying diagnoses (e.g., alcohol withdrawal, subdural hematomas) to further ground the conversation in the profile.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate follow-up questions and explanations. The closing summary and safety netting are well done.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The advice to monitor for new symptoms and avoid heavy lifting is appropriate for a light case.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in. How have you been feeling lately, and what brings you in today?

**Patient**: I've been a bit concerned because my shoulder feels weak lately. That's the main reason I wanted to get checked out.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your shoulder—when did you first notice the weakness, and has it been getting better, worse, or staying about the same since then?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly when it started, but it's been a few days. The weakness hasn't really changed much—it's just kind of stayed the same.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily routine—has the shoulder weakness made it difficult to do things like lifting objects, reaching overhead, or getting dressed?

**Patient**: Yes, it's made lifting things and reaching up a bit harder than usual. Getting dressed is doable, but I notice the weakness more when I try to use my shoulder for anything heavy.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any pain, numbness, tingling, or changes in movement in your arm or hand?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any pain, numbness, or tingling in my arm or hand. It's mainly just the weakness in my shoulder.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has anything seemed to trigger the weakness, like physical activity or certain movements, or does it happen regardless of what you’re doing?

**Patient**: It seems to happen no matter what I’m doing. Certain movements, like lifting, make me notice it more, but it doesn’t really seem triggered by anything specific.

**Doctor**: I see. Since this has been going on for a few days, have you had any recent injuries, falls, or overuse of your shoulder that might explain the change?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any injuries or falls, and I haven't really overused my shoulder lately. The weakness just sort of showed up on its own.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall health—have you noticed any changes in your memory, confusion, or feeling disoriented at any point recently?

**Patient**: I did have some confusion and felt a bit disoriented when I was admitted, but that's been getting better since then.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since your confusion and disorientation have been improving, have you noticed any changes in your shoulder weakness as your mental clarity has gotten better, or has that stayed about the same?

**Patient**: No, my shoulder weakness has pretty much stayed the same, even as the confusion has gotten better.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your shoulder issue has lasted a few days and seems unrelated to injury or overuse. You also mentioned some confusion that started around the same time but is now improving. Sometimes, general medical conditions—like infections or metabolic changes—can cause both mild weakness and temporary confusion, especially in people as they get older.

Since your mental clarity is improving but your shoulder remains unchanged, this suggests the two symptoms may not be directly connected, but it's still important to consider them together. Most commonly, isolated mild weakness without pain or sensory changes can be due to simple muscle fatigue or mild inflammation, but we also want to rule out anything affecting the nerves or circulation.

For now, I recommend monitoring for any new symptoms such as worsening weakness, pain, numbness, speech changes, or trouble with coordination. If any of those develop, let us know right away. Gentle movement and avoiding heavy lifting can help while we watch for improvement. If things don’t get better or new symptoms appear, we may consider further evaluation.

Does that make sense? Is there anything else you’ve noticed that you’d like to mention?

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining it clearly. I haven’t noticed any new symptoms besides what we talked about. I’ll keep an eye out and let you know if anything changes.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 59-year-old man admitted after being found down on the street with a possible seizure. On arrival, he was tremulous, tachycardic, hypertensive, agitated, and had increasing confusion throughout the day, requiring escalating doses of Valium (10 mg every hour for four hours) without adequate symptom control. His past medical history and allergies are unknown; he is apparently homeless with an unquantified history of alcohol use and denies tobacco or intravenous drug use. On physical exam, he was awake but speaking unintelligibly, tremulous, disoriented to place and date, and attempting to drink from his intravenous line; vital signs showed mild fever, hypertension, and tachycardia. Cardiovascular exam revealed tachycardia with regular rhythm, lungs were clear, abdomen was soft with a large reducible umbilical hernia, and there were abrasions on the forehead but no other trauma. The documented clinical impression was severe agitation and confusion with suspected alcohol withdrawal. Treatment included escalating benzodiazepine administration (Valium) and transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring and management of withdrawal symptoms.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with shoulder weakness as the chief complaint. The weakness had been present for a few days, remained unchanged, and was not associated with pain, numbness, tingling, or recent injury; it was most noticeable during lifting or reaching but not triggered by specific activities. The patient also reported recent confusion and disorientation that began around the same time as the shoulder weakness but had since improved, while the weakness persisted. No history of falls, overuse, or other injuries was noted, and there were no current changes in memory or orientation. On assessment, the doctor noted isolated mild shoulder weakness without sensory changes and improving mental status, suggesting the symptoms may not be directly connected but could be related to general medical conditions such as infection or metabolic changes. The doctor recommended monitoring for new symptoms including worsening weakness, pain, numbness, speech changes, or coordination problems, and advised gentle movement and avoiding heavy lifting. Further evaluation was suggested if symptoms do not improve or new symptoms develop. The patient understood and agreed to monitor for changes.
