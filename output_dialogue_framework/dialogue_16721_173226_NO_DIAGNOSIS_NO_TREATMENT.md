## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the shoulder weakness, explores associated symptoms, and connects the history of delirium (resolving) with the current complaint. The reasoning is cautious and avoids unsupported diagnoses or interventions. The patient responses are clear and relevant. There are no obvious hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers. For even greater realism, the patient could offer more detail about daily activities or express concerns about possible causes.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's underlying diagnoses (e.g., alcohol withdrawal, subdural hematomas) to further ground the conversation in the profile.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate follow-up questions and explanations. The closing summary and safety netting are well done.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The advice to monitor for new symptoms and avoid heavy lifting is appropriate for a light case.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in. How have you been feeling lately, and what brings you in today?

**Patient**: I've been a bit concerned because my shoulder feels weak lately. That's the main reason I wanted to get checked out.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your shoulder—when did you first notice the weakness, and has it been getting better, worse, or staying about the same since then?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly when it started, but it's been a few days. The weakness hasn't really changed much—it's just kind of stayed the same.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily routine—has the shoulder weakness made it difficult to do things like lifting objects, reaching overhead, or getting dressed?

**Patient**: Yes, it's made lifting things and reaching up a bit harder than usual. Getting dressed is doable, but I notice the weakness more when I try to use my shoulder for anything heavy.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any pain, numbness, tingling, or changes in movement in your arm or hand?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any pain, numbness, or tingling in my arm or hand. It's mainly just the weakness in my shoulder.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has anything seemed to trigger the weakness, like physical activity or certain movements, or does it happen regardless of what you’re doing?

**Patient**: It seems to happen no matter what I’m doing. Certain movements, like lifting, make me notice it more, but it doesn’t really seem triggered by anything specific.

**Doctor**: I see. Since this has been going on for a few days, have you had any recent injuries, falls, or overuse of your shoulder that might explain the change?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any injuries or falls, and I haven't really overused my shoulder lately. The weakness just sort of showed up on its own.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall health—have you noticed any changes in your memory, confusion, or feeling disoriented at any point recently?

**Patient**: I did have some confusion and felt a bit disoriented when I was admitted, but that's been getting better since then.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since your confusion and disorientation have been improving, have you noticed any changes in your shoulder weakness as your mental clarity has gotten better, or has that stayed about the same?

**Patient**: No, my shoulder weakness has pretty much stayed the same, even as the confusion has gotten better.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your shoulder issue has lasted a few days and seems unrelated to injury or overuse. You also mentioned some confusion that started around the same time but is now improving. Sometimes, general medical conditions—like infections or metabolic changes—can cause both mild weakness and temporary confusion, especially in people as they get older.

Since your mental clarity is improving but your shoulder remains unchanged, this suggests the two symptoms may not be directly connected, but it's still important to consider them together. Most commonly, isolated mild weakness without pain or sensory changes can be due to simple muscle fatigue or mild inflammation, but we also want to rule out anything affecting the nerves or circulation.

For now, I recommend monitoring for any new symptoms such as worsening weakness, pain, numbness, speech changes, or trouble with coordination. If any of those develop, let us know right away. Gentle movement and avoiding heavy lifting can help while we watch for improvement. If things don’t get better or new symptoms appear, we may consider further evaluation.

Does that make sense? Is there anything else you’ve noticed that you’d like to mention?

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining it clearly. I haven’t noticed any new symptoms besides what we talked about. I’ll keep an eye out and let you know if anything changes.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 59-year-old man admitted after being found down on the street, possibly following a seizure. On arrival, he was tremulous, tachycardic, hypertensive, agitated, and confused, with increasing benzodiazepine requirements and disorientation; he later developed right shoulder weakness and required intubation for respiratory distress. His past medical history and allergies are unknown, but he has a history of alcohol use and is homeless. The documented diagnoses were alcohol withdrawal with delirium tremens and aspiration pneumonia. He was treated with an Ativan drip, then transitioned to oral Librium and Ativan as needed, and completed a 14-day course of levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was provided, and physical therapy was initiated for shoulder weakness, which improved during admission. Imaging revealed small bilateral subdural hematomas, pontine myelinolysis consistent with alcohol toxicity, and old rib fractures; a widened mediastinum was attributed to thoracic spine osteophytes. Psychiatry evaluated him as capable of making medical decisions, and he declined inpatient addiction rehabilitation. At discharge, his condition was stable and he was transferred to rehabilitation.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with shoulder weakness as the chief complaint. The weakness has been present for a few days, has remained stable, and is not associated with pain, numbness, tingling, or recent injury; it is most noticeable during lifting or reaching but not triggered by specific activities. The patient also reported recent confusion and disorientation that began around the same time as the shoulder weakness but has since improved, while the shoulder symptoms have persisted. There is no history of trauma, overuse, or other neurological symptoms.

The clinical impression is that the shoulder weakness is likely due to mild muscle fatigue or inflammation, with consideration of possible general medical causes given the recent confusion. The treatment plan includes monitoring for new or worsening symptoms such as increased weakness, pain, numbness, speech changes, or coordination problems, and advising gentle movement while avoiding heavy lifting. Further evaluation may be considered if symptoms do not improve or new issues arise.
