## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.900
- **Justification**: The dialogue is realistic and plausible for a primary-care or ED setting given the patient's symptoms and history. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the onset and characteristics of hematemesis and melena, as well as associated symptoms like lightheadedness. The patient provides clear, relevant answers. There are no hallucinations or unsupported content. The simulation ends prematurely due to a technical issue, not a content problem.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Continue to provide clear, relevant answers to the doctor's questions. If unsure about timing or details, it's appropriate to say so, as was done here.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor's questions are appropriate and focused. Consider also asking about abdominal pain, medication use (e.g., NSAIDs, anticoagulants), and prior history of GI bleeding if the conversation continued.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is natural and logical. The simulation ended abruptly; ensure the patient agent is able to respond to all prompts to allow for a more complete exchange.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns in the content provided. The questions are clinically relevant and phrased clearly.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in—how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I came in because I was throwing up blood and noticed my stools were really dark, almost black. That had me pretty concerned.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first notice the vomiting and dark stools?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think the vomiting and dark stools started just a couple of days ago. It all happened pretty close together.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the vomiting—was there a large amount of blood, or just streaks or specks? And have you felt lightheaded or faint at any point?

## EHR Summary

The patient is an 83-year-old female presenting with hematemesis and melanotic stools. She experienced two episodes of hematemesis and multiple episodes of melena, with one episode of hypotension in the Emergency Department. Her past medical history includes cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and a prior seizure disorder; she was treated for a congestive heart failure flare one month ago. On examination, she was hemodynamically stable after fluid resuscitation, with right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness and 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema; neurologically, she had some right facial weakness. Laboratory results showed a hematocrit of 31.6 and an INR of 4.2. The clinical impression was upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment included intravenous fluids, nasogastric lavage (grossly bloody), administration of vitamin K, and transfusion of two units of fresh frozen plasma. The patient was designated as Do-Not-Resuscitate and Do-Not-Intubate, and did not report shortness of breath or chest pain.

## Dialogue Summary
