## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the patient's symptoms and provides reasonable explanations and advice for a mild case of hoarseness and sore throat with mild airway symptoms. The conversation avoids unsupported diagnoses or interventions, and the reasoning is grounded in the information given. The patient responses are coherent and realistic, and there are no obvious hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses understanding. For even greater realism, the patient could occasionally express uncertainty or ask clarifying questions about the advice or next steps.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. To further improve, the doctor could briefly mention the known diagnosis of vocal cord polyp (from the profile) when discussing possible causes, to more closely align with the provided context.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate back-and-forth. The summary and plan are repeated at the end, which is realistic but could be slightly condensed to avoid redundancy.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The safety netting is appropriate for a light case. The doctor clearly explains when to seek further care. No major safety or clarity concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've noticed my voice has been getting more hoarse lately, and it's starting to worry me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long you've been noticing the change in your voice. Did it come on suddenly, or has it been getting worse over time?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it started, but the hoarseness has been getting worse over time. It didn't come on all at once.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you had a sore throat, cough, or difficulty swallowing along with the hoarseness?

**Patient**: Yes, I've had a sore throat along with the hoarseness. I've also noticed it feels a little harder to breathe, almost like something is making it harder for air to get through.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you say it's a little harder to breathe, does that happen all the time or only when you're talking or moving around? Is it getting worse, or does it stay about the same throughout the day?

**Patient**: It seems to be there most of the time, not just when I'm talking or moving around. I don't think it's getting much worse during the day, it just stays about the same.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how much this is affecting your day-to-day life. Are you able to do your usual activities, or has it made things like talking, eating, or walking more difficult for you?

**Patient**: Talking has definitely become more difficult because of the hoarseness and sore throat. I can still eat and walk around, but I have to take things a bit slower than usual.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your sore throat—do you notice any triggers that make it worse, like eating certain foods, talking loudly, or being in dry environments? Or does it seem pretty constant regardless of what you do?

**Patient**: It seems pretty constant, no matter what I do. I haven't noticed anything specific making it worse.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you breathe in, do you ever hear any unusual sounds like wheezing or a high-pitched noise? And do you feel short of breath when lying down or only when upright?

**Patient**: I haven't noticed any wheezing or high-pitched noises when I breathe in. The shortness of breath feels about the same whether I'm lying down or upright.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you've mentioned taking things a bit slower, do you ever feel tired or fatigued from the extra effort to talk or breathe, or is your energy level about the same as usual?

**Patient**: Yes, I do feel more tired than usual, especially after talking for a while. My energy just isn’t quite what it used to be.

**Doctor**: From what we've discussed, it sounds like your main concerns are the gradually worsening hoarseness, persistent sore throat, and some mild difficulty with breathing and fatigue, especially after talking. These symptoms can often be caused by common issues like vocal strain, chronic irritation from allergies or acid reflux, or mild inflammation of the voice box (larynx). Sometimes, in older adults, changes in the voice can also be related to age-related changes in the vocal cords.

However, since you’re experiencing both voice changes and a sense of airway obstruction, it's important to make sure there’s no underlying issue affecting your throat or voice box more seriously—like a persistent infection, growth, or polyp. Most of these causes are benign, but any new or worsening hoarseness that lasts for several weeks, especially with breathing changes, deserves a closer look.

What I’d suggest is keeping track of any changes—like if you develop pain when swallowing, coughing up blood, or if your breathing gets noticeably worse. For now, resting your voice, staying well-hydrated, and avoiding irritants like smoke or very dry air may help. If things don’t improve over the next couple of weeks or if symptoms worsen, a visit with an ear, nose, and throat specialist would be a good next step.

Let me know if you have any questions about what I’ve explained or if there’s anything else you’d like to share about your symptoms.

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll keep an eye on any changes like you said. If things don’t get better, I’m open to seeing a specialist.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms seem consistent with a common irritation or inflammation around the voice box, which can happen as we get older or with repeated strain. The gradual onset and persistence suggest it isn't a sudden infection, and the absence of alarming signs like noisy breathing or difficulty swallowing is reassuring.

What often happens in cases like this is that the vocal cords can become inflamed from overuse, dryness, or mild reflux, making talking more tiring and causing hoarseness. Since you're able to eat and move about, and the breathing difficulty isn't severe or worsening rapidly, this points away from anything immediately dangerous.

My advice would be to rest your voice when possible and keep hydrated. If you notice your symptoms getting worse—especially if you develop pain with swallowing, a lump sensation, or significant changes in breathing—reach out sooner. Otherwise, if things don't improve in a couple of weeks, seeing a specialist would be a sensible next step.

Let me know if you have any questions about this plan or if there’s anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your symptoms.

**Patient**: That makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I’ll try to rest my voice and watch for any new symptoms. If anything changes or gets worse, I’ll let you know.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 77-year-old woman presenting with increased hoarseness and sore throat for the past week. She has a history of hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, and vocal cord polyps. Examination with fiberoptic scope revealed a 3 by 3 mm left vocal cord polyp prolapsing into the trachea, causing airway obstruction and edema. She was started on Decadron and Unasyn, and her Coumadin was discontinued due to an elevated INR and completion of deep venous thrombosis treatment. The documented diagnosis was airway obstruction secondary to vocal cord polyp and edema. Swelling decreased during hospitalization, and she was discharged in stable condition. The plan includes follow-up laboratory testing and scheduled surgical removal of the polyp.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with the chief complaint of gradually worsening hoarseness. Key symptoms include persistent hoarseness, a constant sore throat, mild dyspnea (shortness of breath) that is not positional or associated with wheezing, and increased fatigue, especially after talking. The patient reports that talking has become more difficult, but eating and walking are still possible, albeit at a slower pace; no specific triggers worsen the sore throat, and there are no alarming symptoms such as hemoptysis or noisy breathing. Relevant history, medications, and allergies are not specified.

The clinical impression is likely chronic irritation or mild inflammation of the larynx (voice box), possibly due to vocal strain, age-related changes, or mild reflux, with no evidence of acute infection or airway compromise. The treatment plan includes voice rest, maintaining hydration, and avoiding irritants such as smoke or dry air. The patient was advised to monitor for worsening symptoms (such as pain with swallowing, hemoptysis, or significant breathing changes) and to seek further evaluation by an ear, nose, and throat specialist if symptoms persist or worsen over the next couple of weeks.
