## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile (young adult female with DKA, vomiting, high blood sugar, shortness of breath, mild fever/chills, and polyuria). The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about symptom onset, severity, and associated features. The explanation of DKA risk factors and home management is accurate for a light/common case context. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe interventions are introduced. The patient responses are coherent and realistic.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses understanding. Could add more detail about fluid intake or urine output for completeness.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor is thorough and empathetic. Could briefly mention the importance of checking for ketones at home if appropriate supplies are available, but otherwise avoids unnecessary escalation.

**Conversation Flow**: Dialogue flows logically from history to assessment to advice. The summary and safety netting are well-placed.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear (when to seek urgent care). The explanation avoids jargon and is accessible. No major concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hi there, what brings you in today? How have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been feeling pretty awful—my blood sugar's been really high and I've been throwing up. That's mainly why I'm here.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your blood sugar—have you noticed any specific numbers or patterns recently, like when it's highest or lowest during the day?

**Patient**: I haven't really kept track of exact numbers, but it just seems like my blood sugar stays high no matter what I do right now. I notice it more in the mornings and after I eat.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the vomiting—when did that start, and how often has it been happening?

**Patient**: It started a couple days ago, and it's been happening off and on since then. I've also been having a hard time breathing sometimes, especially when my blood sugar is up.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your breathing—when you say you have a hard time breathing, is it more like shortness of breath, or do you feel tightness in your chest? And does it happen only when you're vomiting, or at other times too?

**Patient**: It's more like shortness of breath, not really chest tightness. It happens even when I'm not vomiting, especially when my blood sugar is high.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you had any fever or chills along with these symptoms?

**Patient**: Yeah, I’ve had some fevers and chills off and on along with everything else.

**Doctor**: Got it. When your blood sugar is high and you're feeling unwell, how much does this interfere with your usual daily activities—are you able to eat, drink, and move around as usual, or is it keeping you in bed most of the time?

**Patient**: It's been tough to do my normal stuff—I mostly just want to stay in bed. Eating and drinking is hard because of the nausea and vomiting.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the fever—when did that start in relation to your other symptoms, and have the fevers been high or just mild?

**Patient**: The fever started around the same time as the vomiting, just a couple days ago. They haven’t been super high, more like mild fevers, but I’ve had chills too.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any triggers that seem to make your blood sugar spike, or does it just stay high regardless of what you eat or do?

**Patient**: It just seems to stay high no matter what I do, even when I’m careful with what I eat. I haven’t noticed any specific triggers lately.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, it sounds like you’re dealing with persistent high blood sugar, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and some mild fevers and chills that all started around the same time. When blood sugar stays high despite careful eating, and especially when it’s combined with vomiting and trouble keeping food or fluids down, it can sometimes mean your body isn’t able to use sugar properly—this can lead to dehydration and a buildup of acids in the blood.

The shortness of breath and fatigue are also important to note, as they can be related to your blood sugar being out of balance. Mild fevers and chills could suggest your body is fighting off an infection, which can also push blood sugar higher.

What often happens in situations like this is that your body becomes stressed from the illness or infection, making it harder to control your sugars. Vomiting and not being able to keep fluids down can quickly lead to dehydration, which makes things worse.

Right now, my main concern is making sure you stay hydrated and safe. If you’re unable to keep fluids down, feeling very weak, or if your breathing gets worse, those are warning signs that need prompt medical attention. For now, try to sip small amounts of water or clear fluids regularly—even if it’s just a little at a time.

Let me ask before we wrap up: have you noticed any unusual smells on your breath (like a fruity or acetone odor) or any abdominal pain?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any weird smells on my breath. I also haven’t really had any abdominal pain, just the vomiting and feeling sick overall. Thanks for explaining everything—it helps a bit to know what’s going on.

**Doctor**: Let me share my thoughts on what might be happening. When blood sugar remains elevated and it’s difficult to keep food or fluids down, your body can quickly become dehydrated and struggle to maintain balance. Sometimes, even a mild illness can tip things out of control, especially if you aren’t able to eat or drink normally. This can make you feel weak and worsen your symptoms.

The most important thing right now is to focus on staying hydrated—try small sips of water or electrolyte drinks throughout the day, even if you can only manage a little at a time. Watch for warning signs such as confusion, worsening shortness of breath, or being unable to keep any fluids down at all. If those occur, it’s important to seek urgent medical attention.

From here, I’d recommend monitoring your blood sugar as best you can, resting, and continuing with fluids. If things don’t improve soon or you develop new symptoms, please get checked in person. Do you have a way to check your blood sugar at home, or anyone who can help look out for you right now?

**Patient**: Yes, I have a glucose monitor at home, so I can keep checking my blood sugar. My roommate is around and knows what’s going on, so she can help if things get worse. Thanks for explaining everything—I’ll try to keep up with fluids, even though I’m running to the bathroom a lot lately.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 27-year-old woman presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She reported one week of elevated blood glucose, with levels greater than 600 mg/dL for 2–3 days, despite increasing her insulin doses as advised. Additional symptoms included vomiting, shortness of breath (noted to have cold-induced asthma), intermittent fever up to 101.9°F, chills, diarrhea for two days, polyuria, and nocturia. Her relevant history includes type I and II diabetes mellitus with prior DKA episodes, chronic sinusitis, irritable bowel syndrome, GERD, depression, and asthma; she is allergic to E-Mycin. On examination in the ED, she was tachycardic (HR 128), hypertensive (BP 153/79), afebrile (T 99.2°F), and had a blood glucose of 953 mg/dL, anion gap metabolic acidosis (anion gap 20), positive urine ketones, and lactic acidosis (lactate 5.0). The documented diagnosis was DKA. Treatment included intravenous insulin infusion and IV fluid hydration, resulting in improvement of glucose and anion gap after several hours.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with persistent high blood sugar and vomiting. Symptoms included ongoing elevated blood sugar levels (noted especially in the mornings and after eating, with no clear triggers), vomiting for the past couple of days, intermittent shortness of breath (described as shortness of breath rather than chest tightness, occurring even when not vomiting and worse when blood sugar is high), mild fevers and chills starting around the same time as the vomiting, fatigue, and difficulty eating or drinking due to nausea. The patient denied abdominal pain or unusual breath odor and reported increased bathroom use. No specific medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. The doctor noted concern for dehydration and possible metabolic imbalance due to persistent hyperglycemia, vomiting, and inability to tolerate fluids, possibly worsened by mild illness or infection. The assessment focused on the risk of dehydration and the need to monitor for worsening symptoms. The doctor advised the patient to take small sips of water or electrolyte drinks regularly, monitor blood sugar at home, rest, and seek urgent medical attention if unable to keep fluids down, if confusion or worsening shortness of breath develops, or if symptoms do not improve. The patient confirmed access to a glucose monitor and support at home.
