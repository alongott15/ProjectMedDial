## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.920
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile of longstanding coronary artery disease and unstable angina. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about symptom timing, associated symptoms, and relieving factors. The patient's responses are plausible and align with the documented history and symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test results introduced. The conversation is cut off due to a simulation error, not a content issue.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Continue providing clear, relevant answers to the doctor's questions. If possible, specify pain intensity or other quantifiable details when asked.

**Doctor Side**: Excellent job eliciting relevant history and clarifying symptom characteristics. Consider asking about medication adherence, recent changes in activity tolerance, or any new triggers for symptoms.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and focused. The abrupt end was due to a simulation error; otherwise, the conversation was progressing well.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The questions and responses are clear and clinically appropriate.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some chest pain, especially when I try to do things like walking or going up stairs. It also came on during my exercise stress test. It's made me a bit anxious lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first start noticing this chest pain during activity?

**Patient**: I've actually had angina for about 15 years, but lately the chest pain during activity feels a bit more frequent. I can't recall exactly when it started getting worse, but it's been noticeable.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any discomfort in your shoulders or neck when you exert yourself, or is it just limited to the chest area?

**Patient**: Yes, I do get discomfort in both my shoulders and neck when I exert myself, along with the chest pain. It all seems to come on together.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—when these episodes happen, do you ever feel short of breath, lightheaded, or notice sweating?

**Patient**: I do feel lightheaded when the angina comes on. I haven't noticed much sweating or shortness of breath, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. When these episodes come on, do you find that stopping and resting helps them go away, or do you need to do something else for relief?

**Patient**: Resting does help the symptoms ease up, but sometimes I need to use my nitro patch to get more relief, especially if it's waking me up at night.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how intense the discomfort feels—would you rate the pain as mild, moderate, or severe when it comes on during activity?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 71-year-old man presenting with unstable angina. He reported a 15-year history of exertional angina characterized by bilateral shoulder and neck discomfort relieved by nitroglycerin, with recent episodes of nocturnal angina and new-onset lightheadedness. He denied any dyspnea. His medical history includes hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, arthritis, and a prior left carotid endarterectomy; he has no known drug allergies. Cardiac catheterization revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease with significant occlusions and an ejection fraction of 51%. The documented diagnoses were three-vessel coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) times three, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and arthritis. Treatment included CABG (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to diagonal), postoperative management, and discharge medications such as Pravachol, Lopressor, Prilosec, Ibuprofen, Percocet, Colace, Lasix, KCL, and ASA. The patient was stable at discharge and advised to follow up with his cardiologist in six weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult with a longstanding history of angina presenting with increased chest pain during physical activity. The chest pain occurs with exertion such as walking, climbing stairs, and during an exercise stress test, and is now more frequent than in the past. Associated symptoms include discomfort in both shoulders and neck during exertion, as well as lightheadedness during angina episodes; the patient denies significant sweating or dyspnea. The symptoms are typically relieved by rest, but sometimes require the use of a nitroglycerin patch, especially if the pain occurs at night. The patient reports anxiety related to these symptoms. The clinical impression is consistent with worsening angina. The current management includes rest and nitroglycerin patch for symptom relief. No new medications or interventions were documented in this encounter.
