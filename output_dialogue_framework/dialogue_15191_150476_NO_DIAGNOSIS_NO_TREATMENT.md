## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile (70-year-old woman with coronary artery disease presenting with chest pain radiating to neck and left shoulder). The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the pain, associated symptoms, triggers, and relieving factors. The reasoning is cautious and appropriate for a light case, with no unsupported diagnoses or interventions. The doctor provides clear safety advice and offers reassurance while recommending further evaluation. There are no hallucinations or role confusion.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce unsupported symptoms or history. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any relevant medications or past similar episodes if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly confirm the patient's known coronary artery disease history explicitly during the conversation, as this is a key risk factor.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate follow-up questions and summary. The closing is supportive and patient-centered.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety is well addressed with clear instructions on when to seek urgent care. The explanation is clear and avoids unnecessary alarm.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what you've been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having this pain in my chest that seems to move up into my neck and over to my left shoulder. It's been making me pretty anxious.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain—how would you rate it on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine?

**Patient**: I'd rate it around a 6, maybe a 7 when it's at its worst. It's uncomfortable, but not unbearable.

**Doctor**: Got it. Can you tell me when this pain started and how long each episode tends to last?

**Patient**: I’m not exactly sure when it started, but I think it’s been going on for a few days now. Each episode probably lasts several minutes, then eases off a bit.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed any shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or feeling lightheaded when these episodes happen?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or feeling lightheaded with these episodes. It’s really just the chest pain going into my neck and left shoulder.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if anything seems to trigger these episodes, like physical activity, eating, or stress? Or do they seem to come on randomly?

**Patient**: I haven’t really noticed a clear trigger. It seems to come on randomly, not just when I’m active or eating.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more thing—does anything help relieve the discomfort, like resting, changing position, or taking any medications?

**Patient**: Resting does seem to help a little bit. I haven’t tried any medications for it yet, and changing position doesn’t make much difference.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the location—can you point to exactly where the discomfort starts in your chest, and is it a sharp, dull, or pressure-like feeling?

**Patient**: The discomfort starts right in the center of my chest. It feels more like a pressure than a sharp pain, and then it moves up into my neck and left shoulder.

**Doctor**: I see. Has this sensation ever woken you up at night, or does it mostly happen during the day?

**Patient**: No, it hasn’t woken me up at night. The episodes mostly happen during the day.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your chest discomfort sounds like a pressure that comes and goes, sometimes moving to your neck and shoulder, without other symptoms like shortness of breath or nausea. While this could be related to muscle strain or even anxiety, the location and radiation of the discomfort mean we should also consider your heart as a possible source, even though your symptoms aren’t severe or constant.

Chest pressure that spreads can sometimes signal issues with the heart, especially in women your age, even if it isn’t brought on by activity and isn’t severe. It’s reassuring that you haven’t had more alarming symptoms and that rest helps a little, but I do think it’s important to be cautious.

My recommendation is to have this checked further—ideally with an in-person evaluation soon. In the meantime, if you develop new symptoms such as severe pain, trouble breathing, sweating, or nausea, seek medical attention right away. Sometimes, heart-related discomfort can present in subtle ways.

Would you like some practical tips for managing anxiety or muscle discomfort while you arrange a check-up, or do you have other questions about what this might mean?

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining all that. I appreciate your caution, and I’ll make sure to get it checked out soon. If you have any tips for easing anxiety while I wait, I’d be interested in hearing them.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 70-year-old female presenting with chest pain. She reported a 7/10 aching pain in the left chest radiating to the neck and left shoulder, which occurred at rest, lasted through the night, and was not associated with nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, or diaphoresis; recent episodes were less responsive to rest and nitroglycerin. Her history includes diabetes mellitus (noninsulin-dependent), coronary artery disease (prior PTCA and stenting), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hiatal hernia; she has a questionable sulfa allergy. On admission, ECG showed normal sinus rhythm without acute changes, cardiac enzymes were not elevated, and cardiac catheterization revealed significant two-vessel coronary artery disease (95% mid RCA, 70% proximal LAD, 90% mid LAD). The documented diagnoses were two-vessel coronary artery disease (unstable angina), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was treated with heparin and nitroglycerin drips, aspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin, and later transitioned to oral Isordil; diabetes was managed with insulin sliding scale during hospitalization. The patient was transferred in stable condition to Cardiothoracic Surgery for planned coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with chest pain as the chief complaint. The discomfort is described as a pressure starting in the center of the chest, radiating to the neck and left shoulder, rated 6–7/10 in severity, lasting several minutes per episode, and occurring over several days. There are no associated symptoms such as dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, or lightheadedness, and no clear triggers have been identified; resting provides some relief. The pain does not wake the patient at night and has not been treated with medication. Relevant history, medications, and allergies are not specified. The clinical impression includes possible muscle strain or anxiety but also notes concern for a cardiac source due to the nature and radiation of the discomfort. The treatment plan includes recommending prompt in-person evaluation to rule out cardiac causes and advising the patient to seek immediate care if severe symptoms develop; practical tips for managing anxiety were also offered.
