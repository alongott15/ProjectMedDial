## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly plausible for a primary-care visit involving a patient with known coronary artery disease and increasing angina. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the nature, onset, and triggers of the chest pain, as well as associated symptoms. The patient provides clear, relevant answers consistent with the profile. The doctor's summary and advice are medically sound and appropriately cautious for a light case, with no unsupported diagnoses or interventions. There are no obvious hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For added realism, the patient could mention any medications they are taking or concerns about their diabetes or hypertension, if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's history of diabetes and hypertension when summarizing the case, and ask about medication adherence or recent changes in health status for completeness.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and smooth, moving from symptom description to impact on daily life, then to safety advice. The transition to management advice is natural.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate for a light case. The doctor correctly emphasizes warning signs and the need for prompt attention if symptoms worsen. For clarity, the doctor could specify what constitutes 'strenuous activity' and offer examples tailored to the patient's lifestyle.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. Can you tell me more about what's been happening when you're out walking?

**Patient**: I've been getting chest pain when I walk, and it seems to be happening more often lately. Once I stop and rest, the pain goes away.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain itself—how would you describe the sensation? Is it more of a pressure, tightness, or something else?

**Patient**: It's more of a tightness in my chest when I'm walking. It gets worse the longer I go, but stopping and resting helps it go away.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about associated symptoms—when you feel this tightness, do you notice any shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any sweating or feeling lightheaded when it happens. It's just the tightness in my chest while I'm walking.

**Doctor**: Alright. How much would you say this is affecting your ability to do your usual activities, like walking around the house or running errands?

**Patient**: It's definitely making things harder. Even walking around the house, I notice the tightness if I move too quickly. Running errands has gotten more difficult because of it.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you stop and rest, about how long does it usually take for the tightness to go away?

**Patient**: Usually, the tightness goes away within a few minutes after I sit down and rest. It doesn’t last very long once I stop moving.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long this has been going on—when did you first start noticing the tightness during activity, and has it changed much over time?

**Patient**: I first noticed the tightness during activity maybe a few weeks ago. It’s definitely gotten more noticeable and happens more often now when I’m walking.

**Doctor**: Okay. When the tightness comes on, would you say it’s mild or does it ever feel quite intense? For example, does it ever make you want to stop immediately, or can you push through it if you need to?

**Patient**: Yes, the tightness can get strong enough that I feel like I have to stop what I’m doing. I don’t try to push through it—it’s uncomfortable enough that I need to rest until it goes away.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what you’re doing right before the tightness starts—does it seem to come on with any particular activity, like climbing stairs, walking uphill, or carrying groceries? Or does it happen with any kind of movement?

**Patient**: It usually comes on when I’m walking, especially if I’m going up stairs or carrying something. Even just regular movement around the house can bring it on sometimes.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you're experiencing chest tightness that comes on with physical activity and improves quickly with rest. This pattern is often seen with a condition called angina, which happens when the heart isn't getting enough oxygen during exertion. It's important to pay attention to how these symptoms have become more frequent and affect your daily life.

For now, I recommend you take it easy with any strenuous activity until you've had a chance to discuss this further with your healthcare provider. If you ever notice the tightness coming on while you're at rest, if it lasts longer than usual, or if you develop new symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or feeling faint, those could be warning signs and you should seek medical attention promptly.

Would you like advice on how to manage your activities safely until you can follow up with your provider?

**Patient**: Thank you, that makes sense. I’d appreciate some advice on how to manage my activities safely until I can see my provider. I want to be careful but still keep moving as much as I can.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 78-year-old female admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to increasing angina with exertion over the past six months, requiring reduced activity and relieved by rest. She previously could walk one mile before experiencing chest pain and had not used nitroglycerin prior to admission. Her medical history includes hypertension, type II diabetes with retinopathy, and prior surgeries. Preoperative evaluation revealed severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease with 90% occlusion of the LAD and left circumflex arteries, and 95% RCA occlusion. The documented diagnosis was multi-vessel coronary artery disease with symptomatic angina. She underwent CABG x3 and had an uncomplicated postoperative course, recovering well and advancing her diet and activity. At discharge, she was in good condition with intact surgical sites and no acute cardiovascular issues. The treatment plan included discharge to rehabilitation, continuation of cardiac and diabetic medications, and follow-up with her cardiologist and primary care provider in four weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with chest tightness during physical activity as the chief complaint. The chest tightness is described as a sensation of pressure that occurs with walking, climbing stairs, or carrying objects, and has become more frequent and noticeable over the past few weeks. The discomfort is significant enough to require the patient to stop activity, but it resolves within a few minutes of rest and is not associated with shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness. The symptoms are now affecting daily activities, including walking around the house and running errands.

There is no relevant medical history, medications, or allergies documented in the dialogue. The clinical impression provided by the doctor is that the pattern of exertional chest tightness relieved by rest is consistent with angina. The treatment plan includes advising the patient to avoid strenuous activity until further evaluation by their healthcare provider and to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms occur at rest, last longer than usual, or are accompanied by new symptoms such as dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, or presyncope. The patient requested additional advice on safely managing activities until follow-up.
