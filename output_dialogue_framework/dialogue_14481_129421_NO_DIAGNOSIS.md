## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about symptoms relevant to carotid stenosis and mild edema, and the patient responses align with the documented symptoms. The doctor's explanations and recommendations are plausible for a light, asymptomatic case, and no unsupported diagnoses or treatments are introduced. The conversation is clear, logical, and avoids unnecessary escalation.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce unsupported symptoms or concerns. For even greater realism, the patient could occasionally express uncertainty or ask clarifying questions.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates thoroughness and clear communication. To further enhance realism, the doctor could briefly mention ongoing management of diabetes and hypertension as part of risk factor control, since these are in the profile.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between topics. The conversation could be slightly condensed to avoid repetitive phrasing (e.g., multiple questions about swelling), but overall it is well-structured.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns detected. The doctor appropriately emphasizes when to seek urgent care and reassures the patient about current findings.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—have you noticed any new concerns or changes in how you're feeling lately?

**Patient**: I came in because they found some narrowing in my left carotid artery, but I haven't had any symptoms from it. Just wanted to get it checked and see what you think.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any changes you've noticed recently—have you experienced any weakness, numbness, vision changes, or trouble speaking at any point? Sometimes these can be subtle, so even brief episodes are important to mention.

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any trouble with my vision or speaking. I do have some mild weakness in my right leg, but it's not too bad.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the mild weakness in your right leg—has it stayed about the same, or have you noticed it getting better or worse over time?

**Patient**: It's been pretty much the same for a while now. I haven't noticed it getting better or worse.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something else that was noted—have you noticed any swelling in your feet or ankles recently, even if it's just a little? Sometimes this can be very mild and easy to overlook.

**Patient**: Yes, I've noticed a little swelling in my feet, but it's just a trace—nothing too bothersome.

**Doctor**: Alright. Let me ask about the swelling—have you noticed if it tends to be worse at certain times of day, like in the evening, or after standing or sitting for long periods?

**Patient**: I haven't really noticed a pattern with the swelling. It seems pretty mild and doesn't get much worse, even if I'm on my feet for a while.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much does the leg weakness or the swelling affect your day-to-day activities—are you able to do everything you want, or do you find yourself avoiding certain things because of them?

**Patient**: No, it doesn't really stop me from doing what I need to do. The weakness and swelling are mild, so I can still manage my daily activities just fine.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed the swelling in your feet—has it been there for weeks, months, or longer? And was there anything that seemed to trigger it around that time?

**Patient**: I think the swelling has been there for a few months now. Nothing specific seemed to trigger it—it just sort of showed up gradually.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your general health—have you had any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels? Sometimes these can provide clues about what's going on.

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any changes in my weight, appetite, or energy lately. Everything seems about the same as usual.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like the narrowing in your carotid artery was found before you had any significant symptoms, and the mild swelling in your feet hasn't caused any real trouble with your daily life. Mild, stable leg weakness and trace swelling that haven't changed over time are generally reassuring, especially since you haven't noticed any other new problems like vision changes or speech issues.

For the carotid narrowing, it's common to monitor things closely, especially if you're not having symptoms like sudden weakness, numbness, or trouble speaking. The main goals are to manage risk factors—like blood pressure, cholesterol, and avoiding smoking—since these help prevent complications. The mild swelling could be related to a number of benign causes, such as age-related changes in circulation, but it's good to keep an eye on it.

If you ever notice the swelling getting much worse, or if you develop sudden weakness, numbness, trouble talking, or vision changes—even briefly—those would be reasons to seek care right away. For now, staying active and keeping your legs elevated when sitting can help with swelling. Let me know if you have any questions or if anything changes—we'll keep monitoring things together.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining everything so clearly. I feel better knowing it's not something urgent right now. I'll keep an eye on the swelling and let you know if anything changes with my symptoms.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a male over 90 years old presenting with asymptomatic left carotid stenosis. He did not report any symptoms, and physical examination revealed good general health, bilateral carotid bruits, and mild right lower extremity weakness. His past medical history includes type 2 diabetes for 30 years and hypertension; he has no known allergies. The documented diagnosis was asymptomatic left carotid stenosis. He was admitted for attempted carotid stenting, which was unsuccessful due to a calcified and tortuous aortic arch. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was restarted on Coumadin 4 mg daily, with an INR of 2.1 at discharge. Discharge medications also included atorvastatin 20 mg daily. He was advised to have his INR checked after discharge and to follow up with his primary care doctor; he was discharged in stable condition.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting for evaluation of recently discovered left carotid artery narrowing, without associated symptoms. Key symptoms include mild, stable right leg weakness and trace bilateral foot swelling present for several months, with no clear triggers or worsening over time. The patient denies vision changes, speech difficulties, numbness, or significant impact on daily activities, and reports stable weight, appetite, and energy levels. Relevant medical history includes asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis; no medications or allergies are specified.

The clinical impression is asymptomatic left carotid artery stenosis with mild, stable lower extremity edema and right leg weakness. The treatment plan includes close monitoring of the carotid narrowing, management of vascular risk factors (such as blood pressure and cholesterol), and conservative measures for swelling (staying active and elevating legs when sitting). The patient was advised to seek immediate care if new or worsening neurological symptoms or significant swelling occur.
