## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, open-ended and focused questions about the patient's symptoms, their progression, and impact on daily life. The patient provides relevant, clear answers. The doctor summarizes findings, explains reasoning, and gives appropriate safety-netting advice without making unsupported diagnoses or suggesting inappropriate interventions. There are no obvious hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient responses are clear and relevant. For even greater realism, the patient could occasionally express uncertainty or provide more detail about how the symptoms affect their mood or specific activities.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and empathetic. For improvement, the doctor could briefly mention that certain serious causes (like stroke) are less likely given the absence of speech or balance issues, but still warrant caution due to symptom progression.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between topics. The conversation could be slightly more concise in places, but overall it maintains a realistic pace.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety-netting is clear and appropriate. The doctor avoids unsupported diagnoses and provides clear next steps. No safety concerns detected.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me a bit about what's been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some weakness in my legs, and it's making me a bit concerned.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long you've been experiencing this weakness. Did it come on suddenly, or has it developed gradually over time?

**Patient**: It’s been coming on gradually, not all at once. I’ve also started to notice some weakness in my arms now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily activities—has this change made it harder to do things like walking, getting up from a chair, or carrying objects?

**Patient**: Yes, it’s definitely made walking and getting up from a chair more difficult for me. Carrying things feels harder, too.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or changes in sensation in your arms or legs? Sometimes these details help us understand if nerves might be involved.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any numbness or tingling—just the weakness in my legs and now my arms.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—have your symptoms been getting steadily worse, staying about the same, or do they come and go throughout the day?

**Patient**: The weakness has been getting steadily worse. I’ve also had a headache, along with some nausea and vomiting.

**Doctor**: Alright. Since you’ve also had headache, nausea, and vomiting, have you had any vision changes, trouble speaking, or difficulty with balance? These can sometimes help point to the cause of your symptoms.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any vision changes, trouble speaking, or problems with my balance. The main things have been the weakness, headache, and the nausea with vomiting.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much are these symptoms interfering with your ability to manage daily tasks, like getting dressed or preparing meals? This helps me understand the impact on your day-to-day life.

**Patient**: Yes, these symptoms are making daily tasks a lot harder. Getting dressed and making meals takes much more effort than usual.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first started to notice the weakness—are we talking days, weeks, or longer? Knowing the timeframe helps narrow down possible causes.

**Patient**: I first noticed the weakness a few days ago. It’s just

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you've had a gradually worsening difficulty with movement over several days, now affecting both your arms and legs, along with headache, nausea, and vomiting. Because these symptoms are progressing and making daily life harder, it’s important to consider both common and less common causes—sometimes things like infections, medication side effects, or even issues with the muscles or nervous system can cause this pattern.

What stands out is the combination of these symptoms getting worse over a short timeframe and starting to interfere with basic activities. While there are many possible explanations, I’d want to make sure nothing serious is being missed, especially since you haven’t noticed numbness, tingling, or problems with speech or balance.

At this point, I recommend you have an in-person evaluation soon—ideally today—to check for signs that might need urgent attention. In the meantime, if you develop new symptoms like fever, confusion, chest pain, sudden trouble with speech or vision, or if you’re unable to get up at all, please seek immediate care.

Would you like advice on what to expect at your evaluation or how to manage symptoms until then?

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I appreciate your thoroughness, and I agree—it makes sense to get checked out soon. Could you tell me what kinds of tests or exams I should expect when I go in?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 56-year-old woman presenting with a one-day history of leg weakness progressing to arm weakness, accompanied by headache, nausea, and vomiting. She reported taking four aspirin for her headache and has a history of a fall with head injury one month prior. Her past medical history includes hypertension and menopause, and she is taking Prempro, Univasc, and aspirin as needed; she has no known drug allergies. On examination, she had right-sided motor weakness and abnormal pupillary findings. Head CT revealed a subacute and acute subdural hematoma with midline shift and minimal hydrocephalus. The documented diagnosis was subdural hematoma. She underwent left frontal and parietal burr hole evacuation of the hematoma without complications, followed by postoperative monitoring and rehabilitation. At discharge, her neurological status had improved, and she was advised to take Percocet as needed for headache, with follow-up arranged in two weeks including a repeat head CT.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with gradually worsening weakness in the legs, now also affecting the arms. The weakness has developed over several days and is making walking, getting up from a chair, carrying objects, and performing daily tasks such as dressing and meal preparation significantly more difficult. The patient denies numbness, tingling, vision changes, speech difficulties, or balance problems but reports associated headache, nausea, and vomiting. There is no mention of relevant past medical history, medications, or allergies in the dialogue.

The clinical impression is of progressive motor weakness with associated headache and gastrointestinal symptoms, without sensory loss or cranial nerve involvement. No specific diagnosis was documented during the encounter. The doctor recommended urgent in-person evaluation—ideally the same day—to assess for potentially serious causes and advised seeking immediate care if new symptoms such as fever, confusion, chest pain, or sudden neurological changes develop. The patient was also offered information about what to expect during the evaluation and how to manage symptoms until then.
