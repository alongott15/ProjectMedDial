## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly plausible for a primary care setting with a patient who has a history of coronary artery disease and CABG, presenting with recurrent exertional angina. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the nature, onset, and associated symptoms of the chest pain, and provides a clear, reasonable explanation and plan. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The conversation is consistent with the patient's profile and case type.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses concerns appropriately. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any medications or prior advice received, or ask a follow-up question about what to do if symptoms worsen.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. To further enhance realism, the doctor could briefly review the patient's current medications or risk factors, or ask about medication adherence, but this is not strictly necessary given the context.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between history-taking, assessment, and advice. The summary and recommendations are clear and well-timed.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The doctor appropriately advises prompt follow-up and provides clear instructions on warning signs.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about any symptoms or concerns you've been having lately?

**Patient**: I've been getting chest pain again when I walk, especially after about a quarter mile. It's making me a bit anxious because of my heart history.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discomfort—does it go away when you stop walking or rest, or does it linger even after you’ve stopped?

**Patient**: Stopping does help—the pain usually goes away after I rest for a bit.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when this started—have you noticed these episodes coming back recently, or has this been going on for a while?

**Patient**: I’ve noticed the chest pain coming back more recently. I can’t say exactly when it started, but it hasn’t been going on for very long.

**Doctor**: Okay. When you get this discomfort, do you notice any other symptoms along with it—like shortness of breath, sweating, or nausea?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any sweating or nausea with it. It’s really just the chest pain when I’m walking.

**Doctor**: Got it. How would you rate the intensity of the discomfort when it happens—would you call it mild, moderate, or severe?

**Patient**: I’d call it moderate—it’s enough to make me stop and rest, but it doesn’t feel severe.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the character of the sensation—does it feel like pressure, tightness, burning, or something else? And does it ever spread to your arm, neck, or jaw?

**Patient**: It feels like a tightness or pressure in my chest. It doesn’t spread to my arm, neck, or jaw.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about whether anything besides walking brings this on, like going up stairs or doing chores around the house.

**Patient**: Going up stairs can bring it on too, and sometimes if I'm doing heavier chores around the house. It’s mostly with physical activity.

**Doctor**: Alright. Since this has started happening again more recently, have you noticed any changes in how far you can walk or how much activity you can do before the tightness starts compared to before?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve noticed I can’t walk as far as I used to before the chest tightness starts. I get the symptoms sooner than before.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your chest tightness is brought on by physical activity and is happening sooner and with less exertion than before. This pattern can sometimes suggest that the heart isn't getting enough oxygen during activity, which is often referred to as angina. The fact that your symptoms improve with rest is typical for this kind of issue.

What stands out is that your threshold for activity has decreased—meaning you get symptoms more quickly than you used to. This is important because it can signal a change in your heart's condition, especially given your history.

While these symptoms are concerning, they're not currently accompanied by severe or persistent pain, shortness of breath at rest, or other alarming features like fainting or nausea. That’s somewhat reassuring, but it’s still important to address this promptly.

My recommendation is that you contact your cardiologist or primary care provider soon for further evaluation. They may want to review your medications, consider stress testing, or adjust your treatment plan. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that bring on your symptoms and watch for any warning signs—such as pain at rest, pain that doesn’t go away with rest, or new symptoms like dizziness or sweating.

Let me know if you have questions or if anything changes.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I’ll make sure to reach out to my cardiologist soon. It helps to know the symptoms aren’t severe right now, but I’ll keep an eye out for any changes.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 61-year-old male presenting with recurrent exertional angina. He reported chest pain after walking approximately one quarter of a mile, similar to symptoms experienced prior to his last cardiac intervention, beginning about three weeks before admission. His history includes coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions, with no known drug allergies and current medications including aspirin, Mevacor, atenolol, Imdur, Altace, and Plavix. On examination, he was neurologically intact, lungs were clear, cardiovascular exam was normal, and there were no signs of peripheral edema or cyanosis; laboratory values were within normal limits. The documented diagnosis was recurrent angina due to significant right coronary artery disease. He was admitted and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) times two with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) grafting. Further details of the postoperative course or additional recommendations are not specified.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with chest pain occurring during walking, especially after about a quarter mile, and expressed anxiety due to a history of heart problems. The chest pain is described as a moderate tightness or pressure that is brought on by physical activity such as walking, going up stairs, or doing heavier chores, and resolves with rest; there is no associated sweating, nausea, shortness of breath at rest, or radiation of pain. The patient reported that the symptoms have returned more recently and now occur with less exertion than before. Relevant history includes a prior heart condition, but no medications or allergies were specified. On assessment, the doctor noted that the pattern of exertional chest tightness relieved by rest is typical for angina and that the decreased threshold for symptoms may indicate a change in cardiac status. The doctor found it reassuring that there were no severe or persistent symptoms or other alarming features. The treatment plan included advising the patient to contact their cardiologist or primary care provider soon for further evaluation, possible medication review, and stress testing, as well as to avoid activities that provoke symptoms and monitor for any warning signs such as pain at rest or new symptoms. The patient understood and agreed to follow these recommendations.
