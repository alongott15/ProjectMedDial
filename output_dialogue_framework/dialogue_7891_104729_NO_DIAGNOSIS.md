## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and chief complaint. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the arm heaviness, explores relevant associated symptoms, and provides a reasonable explanation and safety net advice. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced. The conversation is clear, respectful, and flows logically.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For added realism, the patient could mention any concerns about their heart history given their CAD and CABG background, but this is not required.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's questioning is thorough and empathetic. For completeness, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's cardiac history when discussing possible causes, but the current approach is safe and reasonable.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is smooth, with logical progression from symptom description to clarification and reassurance. The closing summary and safety net are well-placed.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate for a light case. The doctor avoids unnecessary alarm while providing guidance on when to seek further care.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been feeling a heaviness in both of my arms every now and then. That's mainly why I wanted to come in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when you notice this heaviness in your arms, does it happen during certain activities, or can it come on while you're at rest as well?

**Patient**: I notice the heaviness sometimes when I'm moving around, but it can also come on when I'm just sitting. I'm not sure there's a clear pattern.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long this has been going on. When did you first start noticing this sensation in your arms?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been happening off and on for maybe a couple of weeks now.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you feel this heaviness, do you ever experience other symptoms at the same time, like chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness along with the arm heaviness. It's just the heaviness in my arms.

**Doctor**: Alright. When the heaviness comes on, how strong is it—does it actually make it hard to use your arms, or is it more of a mild, bothersome feeling?

**Patient**: It's more of a mild, bothersome feeling. It doesn't really stop me from using my arms, but I do notice it when it happens.

**Doctor**: Got it. Over the past couple of weeks, have you noticed the heaviness getting more frequent or intense, or has it stayed about the same?

**Patient**: It's stayed about the same. I haven't noticed it getting worse or happening more often.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily routine—have you started any new activities, exercises, or chores recently that might be putting extra strain on your arms?

**Patient**: No, I haven't changed anything in my routine or started any new activities lately. Everything's been pretty much the same for me.

**Doctor**: I see. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hands or fingers when this heaviness occurs?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in my hands or fingers when the heaviness happens. It's just that heavy feeling in both arms.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like the heaviness you’re describing is mild, not worsening, and isn’t associated with other concerning symptoms like weakness, numbness, chest discomfort, or shortness of breath. That’s reassuring, as those additional symptoms could point to something more serious.

In many cases, a mild feeling of heaviness in both arms—especially when there haven’t been changes in activity or routine—can be related to circulation, mild muscle fatigue, or sometimes even posture. However, it’s important to keep an eye out for any changes, such as the heaviness becoming more intense, persistent, or starting to occur with other symptoms.

For now, I’d recommend you continue your normal activities and notice if anything specific seems to bring the feeling on. If you do develop new symptoms like chest pain, significant weakness, or shortness of breath, please seek medical attention promptly.

Does that make sense? Is there anything else about this sensation or your health that you’re concerned about today?

**Patient**: That makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I feel better knowing it's nothing too serious right now. I'll keep an eye out for any changes like you said.
