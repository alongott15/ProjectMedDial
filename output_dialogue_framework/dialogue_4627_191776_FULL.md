## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor appropriately explores the patient's symptoms, considers relevant differential diagnoses, and provides a reasonable explanation and advice for mild, stress-related shortness of breath. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or contradictions with the profile. The conversation is clear, respectful, and flows logically.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses concerns appropriately. For improvement, the patient could mention any impact on daily activities or clarify if abnormal menses are related to current symptoms, if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and empathetic. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's history of ASD and reassure that the described symptoms do not suggest a recurrence or complication, given the patient's cardiac history.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is natural and logical, with good transitions between topics. To enhance realism, the doctor could offer to schedule a follow-up or provide written resources on relaxation techniques.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The doctor clearly advises when to seek further evaluation for more serious symptoms. Clarity is excellent throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hi, it’s good to see you today. What’s been bothering you or bringing you in?

**Patient**: I've just been feeling really short of breath lately, like it's kind of hard to get a full breath in.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed this—how long have you been experiencing the shortness of breath?

**Patient**: I'm not totally sure when it started, but I think it's been going on for a few days now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any wheezing, cough, or chest tightness along with this?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any wheezing or coughing. I do get this weird feeling like I'm suffocating though, kind of like I can't catch my breath.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if this sensation happens more when you’re active, at rest, or in certain situations—like when you’re stressed or lying down?

**Patient**: It seems to get worse when I'm stressed out, but I haven't really noticed a difference with being active or lying down.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you feel this way, do you ever notice any lightheadedness, dizziness, or a racing heartbeat?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any lightheadedness, dizziness, or a racing heartbeat with it.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall health—have you had any recent illnesses, allergies, or changes in your environment that might be affecting your breathing?

**Patient**: No, I haven't been sick recently and nothing has changed in my environment. The only allergy I know of is to Sudafed.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you’re having these episodes, do you ever wake up at night feeling short of breath or have trouble falling asleep because of it?

**Patient**: No, I don't wake up at night feeling short of breath, and it hasn't really affected my sleep.

**Doctor**: Alright. When these episodes happen, do you find that taking slow, deep breaths helps, or does it make the sensation worse? Sometimes, understanding how your breathing responds can give us clues about what might be going on.

**Patient**: Taking slow, deep breaths does help a bit. It makes the feeling of suffocation less intense when I focus on my breathing.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, it sounds like your shortness of breath is most noticeable during times of stress and improves when you focus on slow, deep breathing. This pattern is often seen with anxiety-related breathing changes, sometimes called “air hunger.” It’s reassuring that you haven’t had other concerning symptoms like cough, wheezing, or waking up at night, and there’s no history of recent illness or environmental changes.

What often happens in these cases is that stress can cause your body to unconsciously change your breathing pattern, leading to the sensation that you’re not getting enough air—even though your lungs are working normally. Focusing on slow, controlled breaths is a helpful technique.

For now, practicing relaxation exercises and being mindful of your breathing when you’re stressed can be beneficial. If you notice new symptoms—such as chest pain, fainting, or if the sensation becomes constant or severe—those would be reasons to seek further evaluation. Otherwise, this is a common experience and usually improves with stress management.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything else you’re concerned about.

**Patient**: Thanks, that explanation actually helps a lot. I was pretty anxious about it, so knowing it’s common makes me feel better. I’ll give those breathing exercises a try. If anything new pops up, I’ll reach out.

**Doctor**: Let me share my thoughts. From what you’ve described, your breathing difficulties seem to be closely linked with stress and improve with relaxation techniques, which is typical for anxiety-related symptoms rather than a physical lung or heart problem. The absence of other issues—like nighttime symptoms, recent illness, or significant changes in your environment—also points away from more serious causes.

My main recommendation is to continue using slow, deep breathing when you feel this way and consider stress management strategies like mindfulness or gentle exercise. If you ever notice new symptoms such as chest pain, fainting, or if your breathing difficulties become more constant or severe, it’s important to seek further evaluation. For now, what you’re experiencing is common and usually manageable with these approaches.

If you have any other concerns or want tips on relaxation exercises, I’m happy to discuss those as well.

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thanks for explaining it in detail. I’d be interested in hearing more about relaxation exercises or mindfulness if you have any recommendations.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 24-year-old female presenting with shortness of breath and a feeling of suffocation. Symptoms had been present for approximately one year prior to admission. Her past medical history includes borderline high cholesterol, gastroesophageal reflux disease, heartburn, abnormal menses, and a sensation of suffocation; she takes Celexa as needed and is allergic to Sudafed. On physical exam, she was afebrile and stable, with a 3/6 murmur at the left lower sternal border but otherwise normal findings. Workup revealed an atrial septal defect (ASD). She underwent minimally invasive ASD repair during this admission. Postoperatively, she required increased oxygen and was found to have a large pleural effusion but no pulmonary embolism; she was treated with diuretics, chest physical therapy, Percocet for pain, and low-dose beta blockers. Her oxygen saturation improved with these interventions.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with shortness of breath, describing difficulty getting a full breath and a sensation of suffocation that has persisted for a few days. Symptoms included feeling short of breath, especially during times of stress, but no wheezing, cough, chest tightness, lightheadedness, dizziness, or racing heartbeat; the sensation did not worsen with activity or lying down and did not affect sleep. The patient reported no recent illness or environmental changes and has an allergy to Sudafed. Physical findings were not directly noted, but the patient stated that slow, deep breathing helps reduce the intensity of symptoms. The doctor assessed that the breathing difficulties are most consistent with anxiety-related breathing changes (“air hunger”) rather than a physical lung or heart problem, given the absence of other concerning symptoms and relevant history. The doctor recommended practicing relaxation exercises, mindfulness, and slow, deep breathing during episodes, and advised seeking further evaluation if new symptoms such as chest pain, fainting, or persistent/severe shortness of breath develop. The patient expressed understanding and interest in learning more about relaxation techniques.
