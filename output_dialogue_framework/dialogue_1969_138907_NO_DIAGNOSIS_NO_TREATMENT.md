## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile and presents a plausible, stepwise clinical history for progressive exertional angina in a patient with known coronary artery disease. The doctor asks appropriate questions about symptom quality, severity, triggers, and relieving factors, and provides a reasonable summary and plan. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The patient responses are clear and relevant. The only minor omission is that the doctor does not address the belching symptom when the patient asks, but this does not detract significantly from realism.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and asks a reasonable follow-up question about belching. Consider elaborating slightly on other symptoms if prompted (e.g., palpitations, edema), but overall performance is strong.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. To improve, the doctor could acknowledge and briefly address the patient's question about belching at the end, as it is part of the symptom profile.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate transitions between history-taking, assessment, and plan. The conversation could be slightly improved by ensuring all patient concerns are addressed before closing.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No major safety or clarity concerns. The doctor gives clear instructions about warning signs and next steps. Addressing the belching question would further enhance clarity.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in. How have you been feeling lately? What brings you in today?

**Patient**: I've been having more chest discomfort lately, especially when I try to walk or do anything active. That's mainly why I came in—it's been getting worse over time.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when this discomfort started—can you recall how long you've been noticing it, and if it's changed in any way over time?

**Patient**: I’m not exactly sure, but I think it’s been slowly getting worse over the past few weeks. The discomfort seems to come on more easily now when I’m active than it used to.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discomfort itself—can you describe what it feels like when it comes on? For example, is it more of a pressure, tightness, or pain? And does it ever spread to your back or down your arms?

**Patient**: It’s mostly a mild discomfort in the center of my chest, and sometimes I feel it in my back too. When I’m exerting myself, the feeling tends to spread down both of my arms. It’s not really sharp pain—more like pressure or tightness.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded when the discomfort comes on?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded when the discomfort comes on. It’s mostly just the chest and back discomfort that bothers me.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much is this affecting your daily activities—are there things you’ve had to stop or avoid because of the discomfort?

**Patient**: Yes, it’s made me slow down quite a bit. I’ve had to avoid walking long distances or doing anything too strenuous because the discomfort comes on faster than it used to.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what helps the discomfort—does it tend to go away if you stop and rest, or does it linger even after you’ve sat down?

**Patient**: Resting usually helps—it tends to ease up after I sit down for a bit. The discomfort doesn’t really linger once I stop what I’m doing.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about possible triggers—does the discomfort ever come on when you’re resting, or is it only with physical activity?

**Patient**: No, the discomfort only comes on when I’m active. I haven’t noticed it while I’m resting.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you do feel the discomfort, how severe would you rate it on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst imaginable?

**Patient**: I’d rate it around a 6 out of 10 when it comes on. It’s uncomfortable, but not unbearable.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms sound like what's called "exertional angina," which is chest discomfort that comes on with physical activity and eases with rest. This often happens when the heart isn't getting enough oxygen during exertion, usually due to narrowed blood vessels. It's good that you're not experiencing shortness of breath or severe pain, but the fact that it's getting worse and affecting your daily activities is important.

For now, I'd recommend you continue to avoid strenuous activity until we can look into this further. If you ever notice these symptoms coming on at rest, or if they become much more severe, are accompanied by sweating, nausea, or trouble breathing, those can be warning signs and should prompt you to seek urgent care.

Next steps would typically involve some tests to check your heart—like an ECG and possibly a stress test—to get a clearer picture. Let me know if you have questions about what we've discussed or about what to watch for.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining that. I’ll make sure to take it easy and watch out for those warning signs you mentioned. Is there anything I should do about needing to belch a lot, or is that related to the angina?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 68-year-old male presenting with progressive exertional angina. Over the past three to four months, he experienced mild back and substernal chest discomfort radiating down both arms during running or brisk walking, which resolved with rest, and reported frequent belching; he denied symptoms at rest, orthopnea, edema, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His history includes hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease, with no known drug allergies. Cardiac catheterization revealed multivessel coronary artery disease with significant left main and LAD involvement, and a cardiac MRI showed mild LV enlargement with an ejection fraction of 43%. The documented diagnosis was coronary artery disease with angina, status post coronary artery bypass grafting x4. During hospitalization, he underwent successful CABG x4 and was treated for postoperative pericarditis and episodes of atrial fibrillation with amiodarone. At discharge, he was stable, ambulatory, and afebrile, with minimal edema and a regular rhythm. Discharge medications included Lopressor, Lasix (for 7 days), potassium chloride (for 7 days), Colace, Protonix, aspirin, Motrin as needed, amiodarone (tapering dose), and Percocet as needed; he was instructed to follow up in two to four weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with chest discomfort as the chief complaint. The discomfort is described as mild, central chest pressure or tightness that sometimes radiates to the back and down both arms, occurring exclusively with physical activity and resolving with rest; severity is rated 6 out of 10. Symptoms have been progressively worsening over several weeks, now limiting the patient's ability to perform strenuous activities, but are not associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness. Relevant medical history, medications, and allergies are not specified.

The documented clinical impression is exertional angina, attributed to possible reduced oxygen supply to the heart during exertion. The treatment plan includes avoiding strenuous activity until further evaluation and instructions to seek urgent care if symptoms occur at rest or are accompanied by warning signs such as severe pain, sweating, nausea, or shortness of breath. The physician recommends further cardiac evaluation with tests such as ECG and possibly a stress test. The relationship between belching and angina was not addressed in the documented advice.
