## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the headache and double vision, explores relevant details, and provides reasonable reassurance and safety-netting advice for a light case. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or alarming contradictions. The conversation is clear, logical, and maintains appropriate roles.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce extraneous or contradictory information. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any over-the-counter remedies tried or express more concern about the new symptoms.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's known aneurysm history (if aware from chart), or clarify if this is a first presentation. A slightly stronger emphasis on the importance of follow-up given the new neurological symptom (diplopia) would be prudent.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is natural and logical, with smooth transitions between topics. The summary and safety-netting at the end are appropriate. Adding a brief check for other neurological symptoms (e.g., weakness, numbness) earlier in the conversation could enhance completeness.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The safety-netting is good, but given the patient's history of aneurysms (if known to the doctor), a stronger recommendation for prompt in-person evaluation might be warranted. Otherwise, the advice is clear and appropriate for a simulated light case.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what's been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been having these headaches, mostly above my right eye. That's the main thing that's been bothering me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the headaches—when did you first start noticing them, and how often are they happening?

**Patient**: I first noticed the headaches a few days ago. They've been happening on and off since then, mostly above my right eye.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed changes in your vision, such as seeing double or blurriness, when the headache occurs?

**Patient**: Yes, I've noticed some double vision when the headache is there. It’s not constant, but it does happen.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you ever had headaches or episodes of double vision like this before, or is this a new experience for you?

**Patient**: No, this is new for me. I haven't had headaches like this or double vision before.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything in particular seem to bring on these episodes, or have you noticed if certain activities or times of day make the symptoms worse?

**Patient**: Nothing specific seems to trigger it, at least that I've noticed. The headaches just sort of come and go throughout the day.

**Doctor**: Got it. When these episodes happen, how intense is the pain—would you rate it as mild, moderate, or severe? And does it ever interfere with your ability to do daily tasks?

**Patient**: I’d call the pain moderate. It can be distracting, but I’m still able to get through my day.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your vision a bit more—when you experience double vision, does closing one eye make it go away? And is it worse when looking in a particular direction?

**Patient**: Closing one eye does make the double vision go away. I haven’t really noticed if it’s worse in a certain direction.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about the quality of the headache—does it feel throbbing, sharp, or more of a dull ache?

**Patient**: It’s more of a dull ache, not really sharp or throbbing. Just kind of sits there above my right eye.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms—a new onset of dull ache above your right eye and episodes of double vision that resolve when one eye is closed—sound like they could be related to the nerves or muscles that control eye movement. Sometimes, mild headaches in this area can be caused by sinus pressure or eye strain, but double vision suggests there might be involvement with the way your eyes are working together.

It's reassuring that the pain is moderate and hasn't stopped you from your daily activities. However, because double vision is new for you, it's important to keep an eye on things. If you notice the headache getting much worse, if your vision changes suddenly, or if you develop weakness, numbness, or trouble speaking, those would be signs to seek prompt medical attention.

For now, you might find relief by resting your eyes periodically and avoiding screens for long stretches. Staying hydrated and using over-the-counter pain relief can help with mild discomfort. If the symptoms persist for more than a few days or get worse, I would recommend reaching out for an in-person evaluation.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I feel a bit better knowing it’s not likely something serious right now. I’ll keep an eye on my symptoms and reach out if anything changes or gets worse.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 55-year-old woman presenting with right supraorbital headaches and diplopia since December 30, 2170. Headaches prompted an MRI, which revealed an aneurysm, and her past medical history includes hypertension. On physical examination, she was in no acute distress with normal HEENT and neurological findings. Angiography identified a dysplastic left MCA trunk with two micro-aneurysms not amenable to therapy and a large right cavernous ICA aneurysm. The documented diagnosis was a right cavernous internal carotid artery aneurysm. She underwent successful GDC coil embolization of the cavernous ICA aneurysm without complications. At discharge, she was stable and alert, prescribed Lopressor 50 mg daily, and advised to follow up in two to three weeks.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with headaches, primarily located above the right eye. The headaches began a few days ago and have been occurring intermittently throughout the day, described as a moderate, dull ache that is distracting but does not prevent daily activities. The patient also reported episodes of double vision associated with the headache, which resolve when one eye is closed; no specific triggers or worsening factors were identified, and there is no prior history of similar symptoms. No other neurological symptoms such as weakness, numbness, or speech difficulties were mentioned. The doctor noted that the combination of new-onset dull headache and intermittent double vision could be related to the nerves or muscles controlling eye movement, and considered sinus pressure or eye strain as possible causes, but emphasized the significance of new double vision. The doctor advised resting the eyes periodically, avoiding prolonged screen time, staying hydrated, and using over-the-counter pain relief for mild discomfort. The patient was instructed to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms worsen or new neurological symptoms develop, and to follow up if symptoms persist beyond a few days.
