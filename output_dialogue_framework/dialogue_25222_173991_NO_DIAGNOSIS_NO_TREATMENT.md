## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly realistic for a primary-care encounter with a patient who has a history of coronary artery disease and presents with new exertional chest discomfort. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the nature, timing, and associated symptoms of the chest discomfort, and provides a clear, cautious explanation of possible causes and next steps. The patient responses are plausible and consistent with the profile. There are no hallucinations or unsupported content; all reasoning is grounded in the patient's history and symptoms.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any home medications or prior similar symptoms if asked, but this is not necessary for this scenario.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates excellent clinical reasoning and communication. For completeness, the doctor could briefly review the patient's cardiac history or current medications, but this is not required given the focus on current symptoms.

**Conversation Flow**: The conversation flows logically, with each question building on the previous answer. The summary and safety netting at the end are appropriate and clear.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate. The doctor emphasizes warning signs and the need for prompt evaluation, which is important given the patient's risk factors.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome—it's good to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having this discomfort in my chest when I exert myself, and it kind of spreads to my shoulders. That's mainly why I came in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what tends to bring this on—does the discomfort happen with specific activities, like walking or climbing stairs, or does it come on at rest as well?

**Patient**: It usually happens when I'm walking or doing something a bit more active. I don't notice it much when I'm just sitting around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when this discomfort first started—has this been going on for days, weeks, or longer?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been going on for maybe a few days now.

**Doctor**: Got it. When the discomfort comes on, how severe is it—would you describe it as mild, moderate, or quite strong? And does it ever make you stop what you're doing?

**Patient**: I'd call it moderate—it isn't unbearable, but it definitely makes me slow down or stop what I'm doing until it eases up.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—when this happens, do you ever feel short of breath, lightheaded, or notice any sweating?

**Patient**: I do get a bit short of breath when the chest discomfort comes on, but I haven't noticed any lightheadedness or sweating with it.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if this discomfort has been getting better, worse, or staying about the same since it first started?

**Patient**: It's pretty much stayed the same since it began. I haven't noticed it getting any better or worse.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what helps—does resting or stopping activity make the discomfort go away, and if so, how quickly does it usually improve?

**Patient**: Yes, stopping and resting makes the discomfort go away, usually within a few minutes. It doesn't linger once I sit down.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more thing—have you ever experienced anything like this before, or is this the first time you've had this kind of discomfort with activity?

**Patient**: This is the first time I've had this kind of chest discomfort with activity. I haven't experienced it before.

**Doctor**: From what you've described, it sounds like the discomfort comes on specifically with physical activity and improves quickly with rest. This pattern is important because it can sometimes suggest that the heart isn't getting enough oxygen during exertion—a condition known as angina. The fact that it's new for you and happens reliably with exertion, along with some shortness of breath, makes me want to be cautious.

While there are other possible causes, such as muscle strain or even acid reflux, the way your symptoms behave—especially spreading to your shoulders and resolving with rest—means we shouldn't ignore the possibility of a heart-related issue.

My recommendation is that we take this seriously and arrange for further evaluation soon. That might include an EKG and possibly some blood tests or a stress test, depending on what we find. In the meantime, I'd advise you to avoid strenuous activity until we've had a chance to look into this further.

If you notice the discomfort coming on at rest, if it becomes more severe, lasts longer than usual, or if you develop symptoms like sweating, nausea, or fainting, it's important to seek medical attention right away.

Does that make sense? Do you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far?

**Patient**: That makes sense, thank you for explaining it so clearly. I appreciate you taking this seriously. Is there anything specific I should watch out for while I'm waiting for the tests?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 64-year-old female presenting with recent onset of exertional chest discomfort radiating to her shoulders. Symptoms began shortly before admission and prompted cardiac catheterization, which revealed 80-90% stenosis of the left main coronary artery, with lesser involvement of the circumflex and right coronary arteries, and a preserved ejection fraction of 70%. Her past medical history includes coronary artery disease, asthma (with prior intubation), hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, oophorectomy, and hypercholesterolemia; she is allergic to sulfa drugs. On examination, she was hemodynamically stable with a systolic ejection murmur and clear lungs. The documented diagnosis was severe left main coronary artery disease. She was transferred for coronary artery bypass grafting. Her medication regimen included theophylline, Singulair, Advair, Lipitor, Prilosec, aspirin, Imdur, and Lopressor.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with chest discomfort during exertion, which radiates to the shoulders. The discomfort occurs specifically with physical activity such as walking and does not appear at rest; it has been present for a few days and is described as moderate in severity, causing the patient to slow down or stop activity until it resolves. The patient also experiences mild shortness of breath with the discomfort but denies lightheadedness or sweating, and reports that symptoms resolve within minutes of resting. No prior history of similar symptoms was noted, and no medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. On clinical review, the doctor noted the exertional nature of the chest discomfort, its resolution with rest, and associated shortness of breath. The assessment was that the symptoms could suggest angina due to possible insufficient cardiac oxygenation during exertion, though other causes like muscle strain or acid reflux were also considered. The doctor recommended further evaluation including an EKG and possibly blood tests or a stress test, advised the patient to avoid strenuous activity until workup is complete, and instructed to seek immediate care if symptoms worsen or new concerning features develop.
