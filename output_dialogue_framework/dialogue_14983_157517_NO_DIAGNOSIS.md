## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, open-ended and focused questions about the patient's new symptoms, explores possible triggers, and checks for associated symptoms and red flags. The patient provides clear, relevant answers. The doctor's summary and advice are reasonable for a mild, unexplained onset of nervousness/agitation in a patient with chronic conditions but no acute symptoms. There are no hallucinations or unsupported content.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce unsupported information. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any coping strategies they've tried or express a bit more concern or curiosity about possible causes.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and reassurance. For completeness, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's history of high blood pressure and coronary artery disease, noting that the absence of physical symptoms is reassuring given those conditions.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate transitions between topics. The closing summary and safety netting are clear.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The doctor provides clear instructions on when to seek further care and reassures the patient appropriately.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've just been feeling a bit more nervous and kind of agitated lately. It's not something I usually deal with, so I thought I'd get it checked out.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first notice yourself feeling this way? Has it been going on for days, weeks, or longer?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly, but I think it's been going on for a few days now. It hasn't been weeks or anything, just recently started.

**Doctor**: Let me ask—have your feelings of nervousness or agitation been getting stronger, staying about the same, or starting to improve over these past few days?

**Patient**: They've pretty much stayed about the same over the past few days. I haven't noticed them getting worse or better so far.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if anything specific seems to bring on these feelings, like certain situations, times of day, or after having caffeine or missing sleep?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed anything specific that seems to trigger it. It doesn't seem tied to a particular time of day or things like caffeine or missing sleep.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much would you say this is impacting your daily life—are you able to do your usual activities, or is it making things more difficult than usual?

**Patient**: I’m still able to do my usual activities, but I do notice it makes things a little more distracting than normal. It hasn’t really stopped me from getting things done, though.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall health—have you noticed any other changes recently, like trouble sleeping, changes in appetite, headaches, or feeling more tired than usual? Sometimes these can be connected, so it helps to know.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any changes like trouble sleeping, headaches, appetite changes, or feeling more tired than usual. It’s just the nervousness and agitation.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since this is a new feeling for you, have you started any new medications, supplements, or had any recent changes in your routine—like work stress, illness, or changes in your environment—that might be related?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t started any new medications or supplements, and nothing’s really changed in my routine or environment lately. No recent illness or big stress at work either.

**Doctor**: I see. When you feel this way, do you notice any physical symptoms along with the nervousness—like your heart racing, sweating, shaking, or feeling short of breath? Sometimes these can go along with feeling agitated.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any physical symptoms like heart racing, sweating, shaking, or shortness of breath. It’s just the nervousness and agitation.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re experiencing a mild but persistent sense of nervousness and restlessness, without any clear triggers or physical symptoms, and it hasn’t significantly disrupted your daily life. In many cases, these kinds of feelings can be temporary and related to subtle changes in your body or mind—even things like minor stressors, changes in sleep quality you might not notice, or natural fluctuations in mood.

The fact that you’re not having other symptoms like trouble sleeping, appetite changes, or physical signs such as palpitations is reassuring and makes more serious causes less likely. Sometimes, mild anxiety can happen even without an obvious reason.

What I usually recommend in situations like this is to keep an eye on your symptoms. Try to stick to your normal routine, get regular exercise, and make time for activities that help you relax. If you notice the feelings getting stronger, lasting more than a couple of weeks, or starting to interfere with your life or sleep, let’s talk again. And of course, if you develop any new symptoms—like chest pain, severe headaches, or feeling unable to cope—reach out promptly.

Does that all make sense? Is there anything else about this that’s worrying you?

**Patient**: That makes sense, thanks for explaining it. I’m glad to know it’s probably nothing serious. I’ll keep an eye on things and reach out if anything changes.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted for elective clipping of an anterior communicating artery (ACOM) aneurysm. He reported no acute symptoms on admission and was described as awake, alert, oriented, slightly nervous, and agitated, with no focal neurological deficits on examination. His relevant history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, and prior coronary artery bypass grafting in 2147. The documented diagnosis was ACOM aneurysm. He underwent elective craniotomy for aneurysm clipping without intraoperative or postoperative complications, aside from the need for close blood pressure monitoring to maintain systolic pressure below 150 mmHg. Blood pressure was stabilized with medications, and he was mobilized without difficulty during his hospital stay. Discharge medications included antihypertensives, lipid-lowering agents, antidepressants, analgesics, and gastrointestinal prophylaxis. He was advised to follow up in two weeks for staple removal and to monitor for symptoms such as headache, vision changes, altered mental status, fever, or increased incision pain, with ongoing primary care follow-up for blood pressure control.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with a chief complaint of new-onset nervousness and agitation. Symptoms have been present for a few days, are mild, persistent, and not worsening, with no identifiable triggers or associated physical symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, shaking, or shortness of breath. The patient denies changes in sleep, appetite, energy, or recent stressors, and reports no impact on the ability to perform daily activities aside from mild distraction. There is no relevant medical history, medication changes, or recent illness reported.

The clinical impression is mild anxiety without significant impairment or concerning features. The treatment plan includes monitoring symptoms, maintaining a regular routine, engaging in relaxation activities and exercise, and seeking further evaluation if symptoms worsen, persist beyond a couple of weeks, interfere with daily life or sleep, or if new symptoms develop. No medications or further investigations were recommended at this time.
