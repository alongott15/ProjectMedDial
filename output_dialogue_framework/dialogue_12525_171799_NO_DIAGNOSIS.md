## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the double vision and vertigo, screens for red flag neurological symptoms, and provides a reasonable explanation and plan. The patient responses are clear and match the described symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The conversation is logical and grounded in the information given.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any relevant medical history or medications if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and clear. For completeness, the doctor could briefly check for other associated symptoms (e.g., headache, recent trauma, visual loss) or ask about past medical history if not already known.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is natural and logical. The conversation could be slightly improved by summarizing the plan at the end or confirming understanding with a teach-back question.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate (avoid driving, seek care for new/worsening symptoms). The plan is clear and conservative. No safety concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in today. What’s been bothering you or brought you in for a visit?

**Patient**: I've been having some double vision recently, and it's been a bit concerning.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the double vision—does it happen all the time, or does it come and go?

**Patient**: It comes and goes, not all the time. I notice it more when I'm moving around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your day-to-day—how much is this affecting your usual activities or routines?

**Patient**: It hasn't stopped me from doing things, but I do feel a little off, especially when I'm walking around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other sensations—do you ever feel lightheaded, dizzy, or like the room is spinning when this happens?

**Patient**: Yes, I do get a mild spinning feeling, kind of like vertigo, along with the double vision.

**Doctor**: Alright. When did you first notice these symptoms starting, and have they been getting any better or worse since then?

**Patient**: I first noticed the double vision and mild vertigo a few days ago. They haven’t really gotten worse, but they’re still happening off and on.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you experience the double vision, does it affect one eye or both eyes together? For example, if you cover one eye, does the double vision go away?

**Patient**: If I cover one eye, the double vision goes away. It only happens when both eyes are open.

**Doctor**: Okay. Have you noticed any other new symptoms, such as weakness in your face or limbs, trouble speaking, or difficulty swallowing? These can sometimes help us figure out if there’s anything more serious going on.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any weakness, trouble speaking, or swallowing issues. It’s really just the double vision and mild vertigo.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if anything specific—like looking in a certain direction, being tired, or reading—seems to bring on the double vision?

**Patient**: Looking in certain directions seems to make the double vision worse. I haven’t noticed it being tied to being tired or reading.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, your symptoms of double vision that occur with both eyes open and get worse when looking in certain directions, along with mild vertigo, are most often related to a problem with how the eyes are working together—sometimes this can be due to minor issues with the eye muscles or nerves. Since you haven’t had any weakness, speech, or swallowing problems, and your symptoms haven’t worsened, this is somewhat reassuring.

What often happens with this kind of symptom is that it can be related to something benign, like a temporary eye muscle issue or even a mild inner ear disturbance contributing to your vertigo. However, because double vision is a new symptom for you, it’s important to have it checked out further to rule out more serious causes.

For now, I recommend avoiding activities like driving until you know more. If you develop any new symptoms such as severe headache, weakness, trouble speaking, or the double vision becomes constant or much worse, seek care right away. Otherwise, arranging an eye exam and possibly a neurological evaluation would be the next best steps. Does that sound reasonable to you?

**Patient**: That sounds reasonable to me. I appreciate you explaining everything—I'll make sure to get the eye exam and follow up as you suggested. Thank you for your help.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 61-year-old female presenting for an elective cerebral angiogram following a prior episode of diplopia and mild vertigo in October 2117, both of which resolved. She reported no ongoing symptoms at the time of admission. Her past medical history is negative for diabetes, heart, or lung disease, and she has no known drug allergies; current medications include multivitamins, aspirin, and Lipitor. On admission, her physical examination and vital signs were stable and unremarkable. The documented diagnosis was a right internal carotid aneurysm. She underwent successful embolization and coiling of the aneurysm, tolerated the procedure well, and had an unremarkable postoperative course. At discharge, she was stable and improved, with instructions to resume her preoperative medications and arrange a follow-up appointment.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with the chief complaint of intermittent double vision. The double vision occurs only when both eyes are open, is worsened by looking in certain directions, and is accompanied by mild vertigo described as a spinning sensation. Symptoms began a few days ago and have not worsened; there is no associated weakness, speech difficulty, or swallowing problems. The patient reports that daily activities are only mildly affected, mainly when walking, and no specific triggers other than eye movement are identified. Relevant history, medications, and allergies are not specified.

The clinical impression is that the symptoms are likely related to a benign issue with eye muscle coordination or a mild inner ear disturbance, but more serious causes need to be ruled out. The treatment plan includes avoiding activities such as driving until further evaluation, seeking immediate care if new or worsening neurological symptoms develop, and arranging for an eye exam and possible neurological evaluation.
