## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.920
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the wound, discharge, bleeding, and associated symptoms. The patient's responses are coherent and match the documented symptoms and concerns. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or major contradictions. The conversation ends prematurely due to a simulation issue, but up to that point, it is realistic.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Continue providing clear, relevant answers to the doctor's questions. If possible, elaborate on any additional symptoms or concerns for a more complete picture.

**Doctor Side**: Excellent job eliciting details about the wound and related symptoms. Consider asking about systemic symptoms (e.g., malaise, appetite) and reviewing diabetes control, as these are relevant to wound healing.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and focused. The abrupt end is a technical issue; otherwise, the exchange is natural.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns in the dialogue as written. The doctor maintains a clear, structured approach.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me what’s been going on or if you have any particular concerns right now?

**Patient**: I've been having some discharge from my surgical wound, and it's got me a bit concerned.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discharge—when did you first notice it, and what does it look like (for example, is it clear, yellow, or bloody)?

**Patient**: I first noticed the discharge a few days ago. It's kind of a clear fluid, but it has a foul smell.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other changes—have you noticed any redness, swelling, or warmth around the wound, or are you experiencing any fever or chills?

**Patient**: I've had quite a bit of swelling in both of my legs, up to my knees. There's also been some bleeding from the wound in my groin. I haven't noticed any fever or chills.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the bleeding—how much blood have you noticed, and does it seem to be getting better, worse, or staying the same over the past few days?

**Patient**: There's been a bit of blood coming from the groin wound, not a large amount, but it's been happening off and on. It doesn't seem to be getting better yet.

**Doctor**: Alright. Since you mentioned swelling in both legs, have you had any trouble moving around, or is it painful to walk or stand?

**Patient**: Moving around has been a little uncomfortable, especially when I press on my calves or my left thigh—it feels tender. Walking is harder with the swelling.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you notice the fluid or blood, does it seem to happen more when you're moving around, or does it also occur when you're resting?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 70-year-old female presenting with discharge from her surgical wound. She reported increasing drainage and bleeding from her left groin wound following recent bilateral distal external iliac and common femoral artery endarterectomies with patch angioplasties. On examination, the left groin incision was dehisced and draining, with serous foul-smelling fluid but no erythema or constitutional symptoms; both lower extremities had pitting edema up to the knees. Her past medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tobacco use, and right renal artery stenosis. The documented diagnosis was wound dehiscence with graft rupture, status post exploration ilial-femoral bypass with graft placement and wound debridement. Treatment included urgent surgical intervention (left groin exploration, bypass graft, wound debridement), intravenous antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin), followed by oral Flagyl and Lobaplatin, wound care with sterile dressings, and physical therapy evaluation for rehabilitation. She was discharged in stable condition to a rehabilitation facility with instructions for ongoing wound care and follow-up.
