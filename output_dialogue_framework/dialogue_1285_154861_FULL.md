## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: UNREALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.600
- **Justification**: The dialogue is generally plausible for a primary care visit about new-onset right supraorbital headache and diplopia. The questioning is logical and the patient's responses are consistent. However, the doctor's summary and reassurance are not well-grounded given the patient's known history of a large right cavernous ICA aneurysm and dysplastic left MCA trunk with micro-aneurysms. The doctor does not acknowledge or reference these significant vascular findings, which are highly relevant to the presenting symptoms and would substantially alter the risk assessment and management. The reassurance that this is 'likely a mild issue' is unsupported and potentially unsafe in this context.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce unsupported information. No major improvements needed.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor should explicitly acknowledge the patient's known aneurysms and consider their relevance to the new symptoms. The reassurance given is inappropriate given the profile; instead, the doctor should express concern and recommend prompt neurological evaluation or imaging.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate follow-up questions. However, the lack of reference to the patient's significant vascular history is a major omission.

**Safety Or Clarity**: There is a safety concern: minimizing symptoms in a patient with known intracranial aneurysms presenting with new headache and diplopia is unrealistic and potentially dangerous. The doctor should clarify the seriousness of these symptoms in this context.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in today. What brings you in—can you describe what's been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been having these headaches, mostly around my right eyebrow area. That's what's been bothering me the most.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the headaches—when did you first start noticing them, and how often do they occur?

**Patient**: I first noticed the headaches a few days ago. They come and go, but it's been happening pretty regularly since then.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any changes in your vision, like double vision or blurriness, when these headaches occur?

**Patient**: Yes, I've noticed some double vision when the headache is there. It doesn't last all the time, but it does happen.

**Doctor**: Alright. Would you say the discomfort is more of a throbbing, sharp, or dull sensation? And does anything in particular seem to trigger or relieve it?

**Patient**: It's more of a dull ache, right above my right eye. I haven't really noticed anything specific that triggers it, and resting sometimes helps a bit.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you've mentioned double vision along with the ache, have you had any recent sinus issues, like congestion or pressure, or any history of eye problems? Sometimes these can play a role in symptoms around the eyebrow area.

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any sinus issues or problems with my eyes before this started. It's just been the headache and the double vision.

**Doctor**: Okay. When you experience the double vision, does it affect both eyes or just one? And does closing one eye help the double vision go away?

**Patient**: It affects both eyes, but if I close one eye, the double vision goes away.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about severity—on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, how would you rate the ache above your eye when it's at its worst?

**Patient**: At its worst, I'd rate the pain around a 6 out of 10. It's uncomfortable but not unbearable.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if the headache or double vision tends to get worse at certain times of day, or with specific activities like reading or moving your eyes?

**Patient**: I haven't really noticed a specific time of day when it gets worse. Sometimes focusing on things, like reading, seems to make the double vision more noticeable.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms sound like a dull ache above your right eye with episodes of double vision that are more noticeable when focusing, and these have been going on for a few days. Since the double vision resolves when you close one eye, it suggests that both eyes are involved, which often points to an issue with eye alignment or the muscles controlling eye movement, rather than something inside the eye itself.

Most commonly, headaches in this area can be related to tension, eye strain, or sometimes even minor nerve irritation. The double vision is less typical with simple headaches and does deserve attention, but since you’re not experiencing severe pain, vision loss, or other concerning symptoms, this is likely a mild issue.

For now, I’d recommend resting your eyes regularly when doing close-up work, staying hydrated, and monitoring for any changes. If you notice the pain worsening, persistent double vision even when not reading, or any new symptoms like drooping eyelid or trouble moving your eye, those would be reasons to seek prompt evaluation.

Have you ever had headaches or vision changes like this before? That can help us understand if this is a new problem or part of a pattern.

**Patient**: No, this is the first time I’ve had headaches and double vision like this. I haven’t experienced anything similar before. Thanks for explaining what might be going on.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 55-year-old woman presenting with right supraorbital headaches and diplopia since December 30, 2170. Headaches prompted an MRI, which revealed an aneurysm, and subsequent angiography identified a dysplastic left MCA trunk with two micro-aneurysms and a large right cavernous ICA aneurysm. Her past medical history includes hypertension, and she is taking Lopressor 50 mg daily. The documented diagnosis was a large right cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm. She underwent successful GDC coil embolization of the cavernous ICA aneurysm without complications. Postoperatively, she remained stable, alert, and oriented, with normal neurological and physical examination findings. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with instructions to follow up in two to three weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with headache as the chief complaint, specifically a dull ache above the right eyebrow. The headache began a few days ago, occurs regularly, and is rated 6 out of 10 in severity at its worst. Associated symptoms include episodes of double vision that are more noticeable when focusing on tasks such as reading; the double vision resolves when one eye is closed, indicating involvement of both eyes. There is no history of similar headaches, vision changes, sinus issues, or prior eye problems. The clinical impression is that the symptoms may be related to tension, eye strain, or minor nerve irritation, with the double vision possibly due to an issue with eye alignment or extraocular muscles rather than intraocular pathology. The patient was advised to rest their eyes during close-up work, stay hydrated, and monitor for any changes. They were instructed to seek prompt evaluation if symptoms worsen or new symptoms such as persistent double vision, drooping eyelid, or difficulty moving the eye develop.
