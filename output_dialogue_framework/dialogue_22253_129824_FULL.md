## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, open-ended questions about the exertional heartburn and tiredness, and the patient provides relevant, clear responses. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or tests introduced. The conversation is focused on symptom characterization and impact on daily life, which is appropriate for a primary care setting. The only issue is that the simulation ended prematurely due to a technical error, not a content problem.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Continue providing clear, relevant answers to the doctor's questions. If possible, avoid technical interruptions to allow the conversation to complete.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. Consider summarizing or reflecting back key points for clarity, and be prepared to discuss next steps if the conversation continues.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and patient-centered. Ensure the conversation reaches a natural conclusion or plan, unless interrupted by technical issues.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns are present in the dialogue as written.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What would you like to discuss or what’s been bothering you recently?

**Patient**: I've been having some heartburn whenever I do things like walking or going up stairs. It's been bothering me lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long this has been going on. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been going on for a couple of weeks now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed feeling unusually tired or short of breath when this happens, or is it mainly just the burning sensation?

**Patient**: Yes, I do feel more tired than usual when I'm active. I haven't noticed any shortness of breath though, just the tiredness and the burning feeling.

**Doctor**: Alright. Does the burning feeling ever happen when you’re resting, or is it only brought on by activity like walking or climbing stairs?

**Patient**: It's really only when I'm active, like walking or climbing stairs. I don't get the burning feeling when I'm just sitting or resting.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much is this impacting your day-to-day activities—are you able to do your usual routines, or have you had to slow down or stop certain things because of these symptoms?

**Patient**: I've had to slow down a bit. Things like walking to the store or doing chores around the house feel harder because I get tired and that heartburn kicks in.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what you do when the burning starts—does it go away if you stop and rest, or does it linger for a while afterward?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 66-year-old male presenting with exertional heartburn and fatigue. He was found to have a low hematocrit and an upper GI bleed due to a polyp, which was treated with polypectomy, resulting in stabilization. His past medical history includes paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, parotid disease, prior GI bleed, transient ischemic attacks, and renal calculi; he has no known drug allergies. On admission, his medications included Lipitor, digoxin, and Protonix, with Coumadin stopped prior to admission. A positive stress test led to cardiac catheterization, revealing multi-vessel coronary artery disease. The documented diagnosis was multi-vessel coronary artery disease. He underwent a four-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and had an uncomplicated postoperative course, including successful ventilator weaning and physical therapy assessment. He was discharged home in stable condition with recommendations for continued recovery and ambulation.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with heartburn occurring during physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs. The heartburn has been present for a couple of weeks and is accompanied by increased tiredness during activity, but no shortness of breath. The patient reported that symptoms do not occur at rest and are specifically triggered by exertion. These symptoms have led the patient to slow down daily routines, making activities like walking to the store or doing chores more difficult. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned.
