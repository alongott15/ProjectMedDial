## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and presents a plausible, stepwise clinical reasoning process. The doctor asks appropriate follow-up questions about the patient's symptoms, including pain characteristics, wound changes, and systemic symptoms. The patient responses are coherent and match the profile details. The doctor's summary and advice are reasonable for a light case with concern for possible wound infection or inflammation, without introducing unsupported diagnoses or interventions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and introduces all symptoms from the profile. For even greater realism, the patient could occasionally express uncertainty or ask clarifying questions.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and addresses all major symptoms. To improve, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's concern about the parotid swelling earlier, and clarify any immediate red-flag symptoms that would require urgent attention.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate transitions between topics. The conversation could be slightly more concise in the summary to avoid repetition.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No major safety concerns. The doctor appropriately advises monitoring for worsening symptoms and suggests contacting the surgical team. For clarity, the doctor could explicitly state which symptoms would require immediate medical attention.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What has been bothering you most recently?

**Patient**: I've been having more pain in my leg when I walk, and it's getting worse lately. That's what brought me in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain—can you describe what it feels like when you're walking? Is it sharp, aching, or more of a cramp?

**Patient**: It feels more like an aching pain that gets worse the longer I walk. After a while, I have to stop and rest because it gets pretty uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed this aching pain getting worse. Has it been a gradual change over weeks or did it start more suddenly?

**Patient**: I think it’s been getting worse gradually over the past few weeks. I didn’t notice any sudden change, just that walking is harder than it used to be.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth in your leg, or is it just the aching sensation when you walk?

**Patient**: Yes, my leg has been swollen, especially the one that was operated on. I've also noticed some redness that extends away from the incision.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about the swelling and redness—have you had any fever or chills, or noticed any drainage from the incision area?

**Patient**: I've had some drainage from the wound at my thigh, and my temperature was over 100.5 for a day. I haven't noticed any chills.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you mentioned drainage from your thigh wound, let me ask—has the amount or appearance of the drainage changed recently, such as becoming thicker, changing color, or developing an odor?

**Patient**: Yes, the drainage looks a bit more than before and sometimes it's white or yellow. I haven't noticed any strong odor, though.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain location—where exactly in your leg do you feel the aching most? Is it mainly around the incision site, or does it spread to other areas when you walk?

**Patient**: The aching is mostly around the incision site, but when I walk, it sometimes spreads further down my leg. Resting helps, but the pain comes back when I move around.

**Doctor**: Alright. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the pain when you're walking versus when you're resting?

**Patient**: When I'm walking, the pain is about a 7 out of 10. When I'm resting, it's closer to a 3 or 4.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re experiencing increasing discomfort and swelling around your surgical site, along with changes in drainage and a recent fever. These symptoms can sometimes occur when the area is healing, but the combination of worsening pain with activity, redness extending from the incision, and changes in the drainage suggest there may be an infection or inflammation developing at the site.

What often happens in cases like this is that bacteria can enter through the wound, especially after surgery, leading to increased redness, swelling, and sometimes fever. The fact that the pain gets worse with walking and improves with rest also suggests there may be some local irritation or inflammation affecting the tissues.

At this point, it’s important to keep the area clean and monitor for any new symptoms such as spreading redness, increased swelling, or foul-smelling drainage. If these occur, or if your fever returns or worsens, those can be warning signs that need prompt medical attention.

Let me ask—have you noticed any issues with your ability to move your leg or any numbness or tingling since this started?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any numbness or tingling, but I did have a sudden increase in pain that my pain medication didn’t really help with. Also, my left parotid gland has been swollen lately.

**Doctor**: Let me share my thoughts based on what you've told me. The gradual worsening of discomfort with movement, along with changes around your surgical site and a recent fever, suggests there could be an infection or inflammation in that area. The new swelling of your left parotid gland is also notable—it could be related to your overall health or represent a separate issue, such as a mild viral infection or inflammation of the gland itself.

Right now, the most important steps are to keep monitoring for any signs that things are getting worse—like spreading redness, increasing swelling, persistent fever, or difficulty moving your leg. These would warrant prompt medical attention. For the parotid swelling, if you develop pain when eating, dry mouth, or notice pus in your saliva, let your healthcare team know.

Practically, continue to keep the wound clean and avoid putting too much stress on your leg. Resting when pain increases is sensible. If you have access to your surgical team or primary provider soon, it would be wise to let them know about these changes so they can evaluate the site and possibly adjust your treatment.

Is there anything else concerning you today that we haven’t discussed?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 73-year-old female presenting with claudication as the chief complaint. She reported several weeks of worsening pain with walking, progressing to significant claudication. Her relevant medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, pancytopenia of unclear etiology, and bilateral carotid endarterectomy; she has allergies to Glucophage, morphine, and codeine. Physical exam revealed +2 edema in the right lower extremity, palpable pulses, and a surgical scar with serous drainage from a recent bypass graft; laboratory results showed anemia (Hgb 10.1), thrombocytopenia (Plt 61), and mild hyperbilirubinemia (TotBili 2.4). The documented diagnosis was peripheral vascular disease with claudication. She underwent a femoral/popliteal PTFE graft with distal PTFE to posterior tibial bypass vein graft. The treatment plan included surgical correction of her vascular disease and post-operative monitoring.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with worsening leg pain during walking. Symptoms included an aching pain around the incision site that intensifies with activity (rated 7/10 when walking, 3–4/10 at rest), gradual increase in discomfort over several weeks, swelling and redness extending from the surgical wound, increased white or yellow drainage without odor, a recent fever over 100.5°F for one day, and new swelling of the left parotid gland. The patient denied numbness, tingling, or chills, but noted that pain medication was less effective for the recent pain increase. Physical findings described were swelling and redness at the incision site, increased drainage, and parotid gland swelling. The doctor assessed that these symptoms suggest possible infection or inflammation at the surgical site, with the parotid swelling possibly related to a mild viral infection or gland inflammation. The doctor advised keeping the wound clean, monitoring for worsening symptoms (spreading redness, increased swelling, persistent fever, difficulty moving the leg, or foul-smelling drainage), and resting when pain increases. The patient was also advised to notify their healthcare team about these changes and to report any new symptoms related to the parotid gland.
