## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the nature, location, and triggers of the chest discomfort, and the patient provides plausible, relevant answers. The doctor's summary and recommendations are reasonable for a light case with progressive exertional angina in a patient with known coronary artery disease. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The mention of possible reflux is reasonable given the belching, but the doctor appropriately prioritizes cardiac causes. The advice to avoid strenuous activity and seek further evaluation is safe and clear.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and volunteers important history (e.g., prior atrial fibrillation). Could briefly mention any current medications or other symptoms if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. Could ask specifically about medication adherence, recent changes in medications, or any history of pericarditis symptoms given the profile, but this is not essential for this light case.

**Conversation Flow**: The conversation flows logically from symptom description to assessment and plan. The summary and safety netting are clear. Consider a brief check for other associated symptoms (e.g., palpitations) given the history of atrial fibrillation.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The advice is clear and appropriately cautious for a light case. The doctor emphasizes when to seek urgent care if symptoms worsen.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some chest discomfort when I exert myself, and it's been getting worse over time. That's mainly why I'm here today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when this discomfort started—how long have you been noticing it, and has anything changed about it recently?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it first started, but it's been getting worse over the past few weeks. The discomfort comes on more quickly now when I walk or do anything active.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discomfort itself—do you notice it in your chest only, or does it ever spread to other areas like your back or arms when you're active?

**Patient**: Yes, the discomfort is mostly in my chest, but sometimes I feel it in my back and it goes down both arms when I'm active.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has this discomfort ever come on when you're resting, or does it only happen during physical activity?

**Patient**: No, it really only comes on when I'm doing something physical. When I'm resting, I don't notice the discomfort.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the severity—when the discomfort comes on, how intense is it? Would you describe it as mild, moderate, or severe, and does it ever force you to stop what you're doing?

**Patient**: I'd call it mild, maybe a bit uncomfortable, but not so bad that I have to stop right away. If I keep going, it gets worse, so I usually slow down or take a break.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much is this discomfort affecting your day-to-day life—are there activities you're now avoiding or finding more difficult because of it?

**Patient**: Yes, I've had to slow down and avoid some of my usual activities, like taking longer walks. Even things around the house feel a bit tougher when the discomfort starts.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—when you feel this discomfort, do you ever get short of breath, lightheaded, or notice any sweating?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or sweating when the discomfort happens. One thing I do notice is that I need to belch pretty often when it comes on.

**Doctor**: Okay. When you take a break or slow down, how quickly does the discomfort go away? Does it resolve completely, or linger for a while?

**Patient**: When I slow down or stop, the discomfort goes away pretty quickly—usually within a few minutes. It doesn’t really linger once I’m resting.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you're experiencing chest discomfort that comes on with activity and improves quickly when you rest. Sometimes it radiates to your back and arms, and you've noticed it's getting worse over the past few weeks. This pattern can be seen in conditions where the heart isn't getting enough blood flow during exertion, such as angina, which is often related to narrowing of the coronary arteries.

The fact that you don't have symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness is somewhat reassuring, but because your discomfort is progressive and affecting your daily activities, it's important to take it seriously. Sometimes, people can experience these symptoms due to other causes like acid reflux, especially since you mention belching, but the exertional nature makes me think we should rule out heart-related causes first.

What I'd recommend is that you avoid strenuous activities for now and schedule a visit with your primary care provider soon for further evaluation. They may suggest tests like an ECG or a stress test to look at your heart function during activity. If you notice any new symptoms—especially severe chest pain at rest, trouble breathing, or feeling faint—those would be reasons to seek medical attention right away.

For now, try to keep track of when the discomfort happens and what activities bring it on, as this information will be helpful for your doctor. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll make sure to take it easy and keep track of my symptoms like you suggested. I’ve also had some episodes of atrial fibrillation in the past—should I mention that to my primary doctor when I go in?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 68-year-old male presenting with progressive exertional angina. Over the past three to four months, he experienced mild back and substernal chest discomfort radiating down both arms during running or brisk walking, which resolved with rest, and reported frequent belching; he denied symptoms at rest, orthopnea, edema, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His history includes hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and coronary artery disease, with no known drug allergies. Cardiac catheterization revealed multivessel coronary artery disease with significant left main and LAD involvement, and a cardiac MRI showed mild LV enlargement with an ejection fraction of 43%. The documented diagnosis was coronary artery disease with angina, status post coronary artery bypass grafting x4. During hospitalization, he underwent successful CABG x4 and was treated for postoperative pericarditis and atrial fibrillation with amiodarone. At discharge, he was stable, ambulating well, and prescribed medications including Lopressor, Lasix (for 7 days), potassium chloride (for 7 days), aspirin, amiodarone, and others as needed. He was instructed to follow up with his surgeon in two to four weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with exertional chest discomfort as the chief complaint. The discomfort has been progressively worsening over several weeks, occurs primarily during physical activity, and resolves quickly with rest; it sometimes radiates to the back and both arms. The patient describes the discomfort as mild but worsening with continued activity, leading to avoidance of usual activities, and reports associated belching but denies dyspnea, lightheadedness, or diaphoresis. Relevant history includes prior episodes of atrial fibrillation. The clinical impression is possible angina due to exertional symptoms suggestive of reduced coronary blood flow, though gastroesophageal reflux is also considered given the belching. The treatment plan includes avoiding strenuous activities, scheduling prompt follow-up with the primary care provider for further evaluation (such as ECG or stress testing), and monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms that would require urgent attention. The patient was also advised to track symptom patterns and report their history of atrial fibrillation at the next visit.
