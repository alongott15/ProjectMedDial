## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the chest pain, explores associated symptoms, and provides reasonable advice for a patient with coronary artery disease and risk factors. The patient responses are coherent and match the scenario. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced. The conversation maintains a primary-care tone and avoids unnecessary escalation.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient could provide slightly more detail about medication use or previous episodes, but overall responses are clear and relevant.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor could briefly confirm the patient's known diagnosis of coronary artery disease earlier in the conversation to reinforce context, and explicitly ask about current medications or recent changes.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between symptom exploration, risk assessment, and safety advice. Consider summarizing key points at the end for added clarity.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate and clear. The doctor correctly emphasizes when to seek urgent care. No major clarity concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s good to see you today. What’s been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: My chest has been hurting, and the pain sort of spreads to my back and jaw.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain itself—when did this discomfort first begin, and how long does each episode last?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it first started, maybe a few days ago. Each time it happens, the pain lasts for several minutes.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed any shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded when this happens?

**Patient**: I haven’t noticed any sweating or feeling lightheaded. I don’t think I’ve had shortness of breath either, just the chest pain spreading to my back and jaw.

**Doctor**: Alright. Does anything in particular seem to bring on the discomfort, like physical activity, eating, or stress? Or does it come on at rest as well?

**Patient**: It doesn’t seem tied to anything specific. I’ve had the pain both when I’m active and while I’m just sitting down.

**Doctor**: Got it. How would you rate the discomfort on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine?

**Patient**: I’d rate the pain around a 6, maybe a 7 when it’s at its worst.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the location—can you point to where you feel the discomfort the most? Is it more on one side or right in the center?

**Patient**: The pain is mostly right in the center of my chest. It spreads out from there to my back and sometimes up to my jaw.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the quality of the discomfort—would you describe it as sharp, pressure-like, burning, or something else?

**Patient**: It feels more like a pressure in my chest, not really sharp or burning. The pressure is the main thing I notice.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything help relieve the pressure—like resting, changing position, or taking any medications? Or does it tend to go away on its own after a while?

**Patient**: Resting helps a bit, but the pressure usually just goes away on its own after several minutes. I haven’t noticed any medications making a difference.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, your description of a central chest pressure that spreads to your back and jaw and lasts several minutes is something I take seriously, even though you haven’t noticed things like sweating or shortness of breath. Sometimes, discomfort like this can be related to the heart, especially in women your age, even if it isn’t brought on by exertion or relieved by medications.

There are also other possible causes—like muscle strain or acid reflux—but because of the way your symptoms present, I’d recommend you don’t ignore them. If the pain becomes more intense, lasts longer than usual, or is accompanied by new symptoms like difficulty breathing, nausea, or sweating, it’s important to seek immediate medical attention.

For now, I suggest you keep track of when the discomfort happens and any patterns you notice. Avoid strenuous activity until you’ve had a chance to discuss this further with your primary care provider or get checked in person. Chest pressure that spreads can sometimes be a warning sign, so it’s better to be cautious.

Do you have any history of heart problems or risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?

**Patient**: I do have high blood pressure, and I’ve been told I have high cholesterol. Thank you for explaining everything—I’ll make sure to keep track of when it happens and let my doctor know.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, your symptoms—pressure in the center of your chest that sometimes spreads to your back and jaw, lasting several minutes, and a history of high blood pressure and cholesterol—are important to pay attention to. Chest discomfort like this can sometimes signal a problem with blood flow to the heart, even if you don't have classic symptoms like sweating or shortness of breath. This is especially true for women, where heart symptoms can present a bit differently.

While there are other causes for chest pressure, such as acid reflux or muscle strain, your risk factors make it important not to overlook your heart. It's reassuring that the pain goes away on its own and isn't getting worse, but I would still advise taking it seriously.

What I recommend is that you contact your primary care provider soon for an in-person evaluation. If your pain becomes more severe, lasts longer than usual, or you develop new symptoms like nausea or difficulty breathing, seek emergency care right away. In the meantime, avoid heavy physical activity and note any patterns or changes.

If you have any questions about what to watch for or how to manage things at home until you're seen, let me know—I'm here to help clarify.

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining all of that. I’ll make sure to call my primary care doctor soon and keep an eye on my symptoms like you said. It helps to know what to watch for, so I appreciate your guidance.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 71-year-old female presenting with chest pain radiating to the back and jaw. Symptoms began at home on 2108-10-22, and evaluation revealed anterior ischemia on echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 54%. Cardiac catheterization showed significant multi-vessel coronary artery disease, including 90% occlusions in several vessels. Her past medical history includes hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm, prior cerebrovascular accident, left nephrectomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. The documented diagnosis was multi-vessel coronary artery disease with anterior ischemia. She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) times four and had an uncomplicated postoperative course, with extra ICU monitoring due to COPD. At discharge, she was stable, ambulatory, and her incisions were healing well. The treatment plan included discharge to a rehabilitation facility, continuation of cardiac and supportive medications, and follow-up with her surgeon in three to four weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult woman presenting with chest pain as her chief complaint. She describes a central chest pressure rated 6–7/10 in severity, spreading to her back and jaw, with episodes lasting several minutes and occurring both at rest and during activity. She denies associated symptoms such as dyspnea, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness, and notes that resting helps somewhat but the discomfort typically resolves on its own. Relevant history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. The clinical impression is that the symptoms could be cardiac in origin, particularly given her risk factors, though other causes like muscle strain or acid reflux are also considered. The physician advises close monitoring of symptoms, avoidance of strenuous activity, and prompt follow-up with her primary care provider for further evaluation. She is instructed to seek emergency care if symptoms worsen, last longer, or are accompanied by new signs such as nausea or difficulty breathing. The patient expresses understanding and agrees to monitor her symptoms and contact her doctor.
