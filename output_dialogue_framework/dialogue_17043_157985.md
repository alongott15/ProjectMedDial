## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly plausible for a primary-care setting evaluating a patient with progressive unilateral numbness and weakness. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about symptom onset, progression, associated features (speech, vision, swallowing, bladder/bowel), and possible triggers. The reasoning is clear and consistent with the patient's profile and symptoms. The recommendation for urgent evaluation is appropriate given the concerning neurological findings. There are no unsupported diagnoses or treatments, and the conversation maintains a respectful, informative tone.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and describes symptoms in a way that is typical for a real encounter. For further realism, the patient could mention any attempts at self-care or express more emotional response (e.g., anxiety or frustration about the symptoms), but this is optional.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates excellent clinical reasoning and communication. For even greater realism, the doctor could briefly mention the need to bring any medication lists or prior medical records to the emergency department, or clarify if the patient has any support at home.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and smooth, with each question building on previous answers. The summary and explanation at the end are clear and patient-centered.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The advice to seek urgent evaluation is appropriate and clearly explained. The doctor reiterates warning signs to watch for, which is good practice.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s good to see you today. What’s been going on that brings you in?

**Patient**: I've been having numbness and tingling on the left side of my body, and it's gotten to the point where I can't really walk. That's what brought me in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first notice these sensations on your left side?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it started, but I noticed the numbness and tingling a few days ago. It just seemed to get worse pretty quickly.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about how this is impacting your daily routine. For example, are you able to do things like get out of bed, dress yourself, or use your hands normally?

**Patient**: Getting out of bed has become pretty tough, and I can't walk on my own right now. I also have less sensation in my left hand and arm, so things like dressing myself are harder than usual.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed any changes in your speech, vision, or ability to swallow since this started?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any changes with my speech, vision, or swallowing. The main thing is the numbness and decreased sensation on my left side, including my arm, leg, and part of my stomach.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your strength—are you able to move your left arm and leg normally, or do they feel weaker than usual?

**Patient**: My left arm and leg definitely feel weaker than usual, and it's hard to move them the way I normally would. The decreased sensation makes it tough to control them, too.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any back pain, recent injuries, or anything that might have triggered these symptoms before they started?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any back pain or injuries recently. I can't think of anything that would have triggered these symptoms before they started.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has this numbness and weakness been steadily getting worse, or have you noticed any moments where it suddenly changed or improved?

**Patient**: It's been steadily getting worse since it started. I haven't had any moments where it suddenly got better or changed.

**Doctor**: Okay. Has this affected your bladder or bowel control at all—any trouble holding your urine or stool, or accidents you wouldn't normally have? This can help me understand if the nerves to those areas are involved.

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any trouble with my bladder or bowel control. That's not been an issue for me.

**Doctor**: From what you’ve described, it sounds like you’ve had a steady progression of numbness and weakness on your left side over several days, without any recent injuries or changes in speech, vision, or swallowing. The fact that this is making it hard for you to walk and use your arm is significant, and it’s important to figure out what’s causing these changes.

When someone develops new weakness and loss of sensation on one side of the body, we consider several possibilities, including issues with the nerves, spinal cord, or brain. The absence of back pain or bladder/bowel problems makes some spinal causes less likely, but not impossible. Sometimes, conditions like a stroke can cause similar symptoms, but usually those come on very suddenly rather than gradually over days.

Given how much this is affecting your ability to move and care for yourself, I’d recommend that you be evaluated promptly—ideally in an emergency setting—so that imaging and a full neurological exam can be done. This will help us quickly determine the cause and start appropriate treatment if needed.

In the meantime, avoid walking without assistance to prevent falls, and let someone know if you develop new symptoms like severe headache, confusion, trouble speaking, or loss of bladder/bowel control. Would you like help arranging transportation to the emergency department?

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining all that. I understand why you think it’s important to get checked out quickly. I can call someone to help me get to the emergency department. Is there anything specific I should mention when I get there?

**Doctor**: Let me share my thoughts based on everything we've discussed. The combination of progressive weakness and decreased sensation on one side of your body, especially since it's making movement and daily activities difficult, suggests there could be an issue affecting the nerves that control those areas. This might involve the brain or spinal cord, and while some causes are urgent, others can develop more gradually.

Because these symptoms are getting worse and impacting your ability to walk, it's important to get evaluated as soon as possible. When you arrive at the emergency department, let them know you've had several days of increasing numbness and weakness on your left side, and that you now have difficulty moving your left arm and leg. Mention that you have not had any changes in speech, vision, swallowing, or bladder/bowel control.

Getting checked quickly will help rule out serious causes and guide the right treatment. If anything changes before you get there—such as new confusion, trouble speaking, or sudden worsening—let someone know immediately. You're doing the right thing by seeking care promptly.

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll make sure to mention all of that when I get to the emergency department. I appreciate your help—it’s reassuring to know what to expect.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 49-year-old woman presenting with acute onset left-sided numbness and tingling, followed by right upper quadrant numbness, difficulty holding objects, and progressive gait disturbance. Symptoms began at 4:45 p.m. on the day of admission and rapidly progressed to inability to walk. She has no significant past medical history, takes no regular medications, and reports a sulfa allergy causing rash. On evaluation, vital signs were stable and oxygen saturation was normal. Head CT revealed a 3.5-cm right-sided mass with hyperintense ring enhancement and mild edema. The documented clinical impression is a right-sided brain mass. Treatment details or specific recommendations are not documented in this note.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with progressive numbness and tingling on the left side of the body, leading to significant difficulty walking and decreased ability to use the left arm and leg. Symptoms began a few days ago, have steadily worsened, and now include weakness and decreased sensation in the left arm, leg, and part of the stomach, without any changes in speech, vision, swallowing, or bladder/bowel control. The patient denies recent injuries, back pain, or identifiable triggers. There is no history of similar episodes or relevant medical history documented.

The clinical impression is a progressive neurological deficit affecting the left side, possibly involving the brain or spinal cord; stroke was considered less likely due to gradual onset. The doctor recommended prompt evaluation in an emergency setting for imaging and a full neurological exam to determine the cause and initiate appropriate treatment. The patient was advised to avoid walking without assistance to prevent falls and to seek immediate help if new symptoms such as severe headache, confusion, speech difficulties, or loss of bladder/bowel control develop. The importance of timely assessment was emphasized to rule out serious causes and guide management.
