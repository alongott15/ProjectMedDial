## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks relevant, focused questions about fever, surgical site symptoms, and general recovery, and provides plausible explanations and advice. The patient responses are coherent and match the described symptoms. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe complications are introduced. The conversation maintains a primary-care tone and avoids ICU-level interventions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses concerns appropriately. For improvement, the patient could mention any medications being taken or allergies if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and provides clear guidance. For improvement, the doctor could explicitly ask about current medications, allergies, or prior similar experiences to further contextualize the assessment.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate follow-up questions and explanations. To enhance realism, a brief summary of next steps or when to seek urgent care could be added at the end.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns detected. The advice is conservative and appropriate for a light case with mild symptoms post-surgery.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in today. What’s been bothering you the most lately?

**Patient**: I've been running a fever since my TRAM flap surgery, and that's got me a bit concerned.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your temperature—have you measured how high the fever has gotten?

**Patient**: Yes, I checked and it went up to 101.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed chills, body aches, or any redness or swelling around your surgical site?

**Patient**: I have had some body aches, and the area around my breast and lower abdomen feels more sore and there's some pressure. I haven't noticed any chills though.

**Doctor**: Got it. How many days after your surgery did the fever and increased soreness begin?

**Patient**: The fever and soreness started a couple of days after my surgery.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the area that feels sore and pressured—have you noticed any warmth, discharge, or unusual color changes at the incision sites?

**Patient**: I haven't seen any discharge or unusual color, but the area does feel more sore and pressured than before.

**Doctor**: Alright. Does the soreness or pressure make it difficult for you to move around, take deep breaths, or do your usual activities?

**Patient**: Moving around is definitely more uncomfortable than usual, but I can still do most things. Taking deep breaths doesn't really make it worse.

**Doctor**: Okay. Have you experienced any night sweats or noticed feeling especially fatigued since this started?

**Patient**: No night sweats. I do feel more tired than usual since this started.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the soreness—on a scale from 1 to 10, how intense is the discomfort right now compared to right after your surgery?

**Patient**: Right now, I'd rate the soreness at about a 6 out of 10. It feels worse than it did right after surgery.

**Doctor**: From what you've described, it sounds like your fever and increased discomfort began a couple of days after your surgery, and the soreness is now noticeably worse than right after the procedure. After a TRAM flap surgery, it's common to have some pain and fatigue during recovery, but a new or worsening fever and increased soreness can sometimes be a sign of infection or a complication at the surgical site.

What often happens in these situations is that the body’s healing response can cause some discomfort, but an infection might lead to symptoms like persistent fever, increased pain, or swelling. The absence of redness, discharge, or color changes is somewhat reassuring, but the increased pressure and soreness are important to monitor.

Given your symptoms, I recommend keeping a close eye on the area for any new redness, warmth, swelling, or discharge. If your fever rises above 101.5°F, if you develop chills, or if you notice any changes at the incision sites, it would be important to contact your surgical team promptly. In the meantime, rest, stay hydrated, and avoid strenuous activity.

Does the discomfort tend to stay constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?

**Patient**: The discomfort is pretty steady throughout the day, especially in the lower part of my breast and abdomen. I also get a bit of a headache along with it. Thanks for explaining everything—it helps to know what to watch out for.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 48-year-old female presenting with fever following a right free TRAM flap procedure performed on 2145-5-3. She reported a fever up to 101°F and generalized aches for one day, along with increased soreness and pressure in the lower aspect of her breast and abdomen; she denied chest pain, dyspnea, urinary symptoms, leg swelling, or cough. Her past medical history includes breast cancer treated with mastectomy and right free TRAM flap reconstruction. On physical exam, the right breast flap was clean and intact with a small amount of drainage but no erythema, and the abdominal incision showed minimal tenderness without rebound or guarding. Laboratory findings included leukocytosis (WBC 22.9) and moderate leukocytes in urine, but no evidence of urinary tract infection. The documented diagnosis was infected hematoma/seroma at the surgical site. Treatment included wound washout of the right breast and administration of vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole (Flagyl). She was referred from clinic to the emergency department for further management.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with fever following recent TRAM flap surgery. She reported a temperature up to 101°F, body aches, increased soreness and pressure around the breast and lower abdomen, steady discomfort rated 6/10, greater fatigue than usual, and occasional headache; she denied chills, night sweats, discharge, redness, or color changes at the incision sites. The fever and increased soreness began a couple of days postoperatively. She noted that movement is more uncomfortable but still manageable, and deep breaths do not worsen symptoms. On examination, there were no signs of discharge, unusual color, or redness at the surgical site per patient report. The doctor assessed that while some pain and fatigue are expected after TRAM flap surgery, new or worsening fever and increased soreness may indicate infection or complication, though the absence of redness or discharge is reassuring. The doctor advised monitoring for new redness, warmth, swelling, or discharge, and to contact the surgical team if fever exceeds 101.5°F, chills develop, or incision changes occur; rest, hydration, and avoiding strenuous activity were also recommended.
