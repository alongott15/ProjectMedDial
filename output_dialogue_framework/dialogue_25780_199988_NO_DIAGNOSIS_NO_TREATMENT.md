## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly realistic for a light, common case involving increased ileostomy output. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about symptom duration, stool consistency, hydration status, dietary triggers, and complications such as skin irritation or dehydration. The patient provides plausible, relevant answers. The doctor's advice is evidence-based and appropriate for a mild case without red-flag symptoms. There are no hallucinations or unsupported content. The conversation is clear, logical, and patient-centered.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant information and asks a reasonable follow-up question. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any recent dietary changes or minor illnesses if present, or express specific concerns or anxieties.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates excellent communication and clinical reasoning. For completeness, the doctor could briefly check for recent travel, antibiotic use, or other risk factors for gut upset, but this is not essential in a mild case.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is natural and logical, with good transitions between history-taking, reassurance, education, and safety-netting. The summary and repeated safety advice are appropriate.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The doctor provides clear instructions on when to seek further care and reinforces hydration strategies.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s good to see you today. What’s been your main concern lately, and how is it impacting your daily routine?

**Patient**: I've been dealing with high output from my ileostomy lately. It’s making things a bit tricky for me during the day.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed this increase—how long has your ileostomy output been higher than usual?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been going on for a few days now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the texture—has the output been more watery than usual, or does it look about the same as before?

**Patient**: The stool has definitely been more on the liquid side lately, compared to what I usually see.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your fluid intake—have you been able to keep up with drinking enough fluids, or have you noticed any signs of dehydration like increased thirst, dry mouth, or feeling lightheaded?

**Patient**: I’ve been trying to drink more fluids to keep up, and I haven’t noticed any signs like dry mouth or feeling lightheaded.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any foods or drinks that seem to make the output worse, or does it happen regardless of what you eat?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any particular foods or drinks making it worse. It seems to happen no matter what I eat.

**Doctor**: Got it. Has the increased output caused any issues like needing to empty your pouch much more frequently, or has it led to any problems with skin irritation around the stoma?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve had to empty my pouch much more often lately. I haven’t had any problems with skin irritation around the stoma, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much has this change affected your daily activities or energy levels—are you able to do your usual routines, or is it making things more difficult for you?

**Patient**: It has made things a bit more difficult, since I need to empty the pouch so often. My energy levels are about the same, though, and I’m still able to get through my usual routines.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you had any abdominal pain, cramping, or signs of infection like fever during this time?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any abdominal pain, cramping, or fever. Just the high output and liquid stool.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, it sounds like your ileostomy output has been higher and more liquid than usual for the past few days, but you haven’t had pain, fever, or signs of dehydration. Often, temporary increases in ileostomy output can happen due to things like mild viral illnesses, changes in gut motility, or sometimes even without a clear cause. The fact that you’re staying hydrated and haven’t noticed other concerning symptoms is reassuring.

What I’d suggest for now is to continue focusing on fluid intake—drinking fluids with some salt and sugar (like oral rehydration solutions or diluted juice with a pinch of salt) can help your body absorb water more effectively. You might also try eating foods that can thicken stool, such as bananas, rice, or applesauce, if those are part of your usual diet.

If you notice any signs of dehydration (such as dizziness, decreased urination, or dry mouth), if your output becomes extremely high and hard to keep up with, or if you develop new symptoms like pain or fever, those would be reasons to reach out for further evaluation.

Let me know if you have any questions about managing this at home, or if there’s anything else you’re concerned about.

**Patient**: Thanks, that helps me understand things better. I’ll try adding those foods and keep up with the fluids like you suggested. Sometimes I do notice some formed stool mixed in, but it’s mostly liquid lately. I appreciate your advice.

**Doctor**: Let me share my thoughts on what you’ve described. When someone with an ileostomy has a higher, more liquid output for several days but is otherwise feeling well and staying hydrated, it’s often related to a temporary change in the way the intestines are working—sometimes due to minor gut irritation, mild viral illnesses, or even just shifts in diet or routine. The presence of some formed stool mixed in suggests your gut is still functioning and absorbing to some degree.

The main concern with high output is the risk of dehydration, so your efforts to keep up with fluids are important. Including foods that help thicken output can also be helpful. Most of the time, things settle back to your usual pattern within a few days.

If you notice your output continues to increase, becomes difficult to manage, or you start feeling unwell in any way, it would be important to check in sooner. Otherwise, monitoring at home and supporting your hydration is a reasonable approach.

Do you have any questions about which foods or drinks might help, or anything else you'd like to discuss about managing this?

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining things so clearly. I’m glad to hear it’s usually temporary. Are bananas and rice good choices to start with, or is there anything else you’d recommend for thickening the output?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 74-year-old male presenting for curative resection of rectal cancer after evaluation for rectal bleeding revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. He underwent a proctocolectomy with coloanal anastomosis and loop ileostomy, with an initially stable postoperative course complicated by high ostomy output, partial small bowel obstruction, abdominal pain, distension, and an anastomotic leak. His hospital course included hypotension, increased white blood cell count, sepsis, and decreased oxygen saturation, requiring ICU transfer, intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, TPN, tube feeds, and percutaneous drainage of intra-abdominal fluid collections. Relevant history includes prostate cancer (treated with radiation), hypercholesterolemia, and peptic ulcer disease; he has no known drug allergies and takes Cardura and Lipitor. The documented diagnoses were rectal cancer, status post proctocolectomy with coloanal anastomosis and loop ileostomy, resolved partial small bowel obstruction, resolved postoperative leak, hyperlipidemia, and history of prostate cancer. Treatment included surgery, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, nutritional support (TPN and tube feeds), percutaneous drainage, and medications such as Lipitor, Heparin, Protonix, Lopressor, Imodium, Vitamin D, Zinc Sulfate, and Calcium Carbonate. At discharge, the patient was stable, afebrile, tolerating oral intake, and meeting nutritional needs. He was discharged in good condition to a rehabilitation facility with follow-up arranged with colorectal surgery and urology.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with increased ileostomy output as the chief complaint. Over the past few days, the patient has experienced higher and more liquid ileostomy output than usual, requiring more frequent pouch emptying, but denies abdominal pain, cramping, fever, or signs of dehydration. The patient reports maintaining adequate fluid intake and has not identified any dietary triggers; energy levels and daily routines remain largely unaffected. There is no reported skin irritation around the stoma, and occasional formed stool is still observed.

The clinical impression is a temporary increase in ileostomy output, likely related to minor gut irritation, mild viral illness, or nonspecific changes in gut motility. The main concern discussed was the risk of dehydration. The treatment plan includes continuing to focus on adequate fluid intake (preferably fluids with salt and sugar such as oral rehydration solutions), and incorporating foods that may help thicken stool, such as bananas, rice, or applesauce. The patient was advised to monitor for signs of dehydration or new symptoms and to seek further evaluation if these occur.
