## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and the case type. The doctor asks appropriate, open-ended questions to clarify the nature and impact of the patient's symptoms, and the patient provides clear, relevant answers. The doctor's reasoning and reassurance are grounded in the information provided, and no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or alarming content are introduced. The conversation remains focused on mild symptoms and avoids unnecessary escalation, which fits the 'light, common symptoms' case type.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant responses. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any recent medication changes or briefly reference their known medical history (e.g., 'I haven't changed any of my heart medications recently').

**Doctor Side**: The doctor does well to explore possible causes and provide reassurance. For completeness, the doctor could briefly ask about recent medication changes or substance use (e.g., caffeine, alcohol), given the patient's cardiac history and anxiety symptoms.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between topics. The summary and plan are clear and appropriately cautious.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns are present. The doctor appropriately advises follow-up if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop. Clarity is maintained throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about how you've been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been feeling a bit nervous and kind of agitated lately. It's not something I usually deal with, so I thought I should mention it.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed feeling this way. Has this sense of nervousness and agitation come on suddenly, or has it been building up over time?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly when it started, but I think it's been building up over the past several days. It wasn't sudden, just gradually noticed I was feeling this way.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily routine—has anything changed recently, like your sleep, work, or stress levels, that might be contributing to how you're feeling?

**Patient**: Nothing major has changed in my routine, as far as I can tell. My sleep and work have been about the same, and I haven't noticed any big increase in stress.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about physical symptoms—have you noticed things like a racing heart, sweating, shaking, or trouble concentrating when you feel this way?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had a racing heart, sweating, or shaking. Trouble concentrating isn't really an issue for me either. It's mostly just feeling nervous and a bit on edge.

**Doctor**: Got it. Has this feeling been getting any better, worse, or staying about the same over the past few days?

**Patient**: It's been pretty much the same these past few days. I haven't noticed it getting better or worse.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you found that anything in particular seems to trigger or worsen these feelings throughout the day, or do they come and go without a clear pattern?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any specific triggers. The feelings seem to come and go without any clear pattern during the day.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your mood overall—have you been feeling down, sad, or losing interest in things you usually enjoy, or is it mainly just the nervousness and agitation?

**Patient**: No, I haven't felt down or lost interest in things I enjoy. It's mainly just the nervousness and agitation.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much would you say this nervousness and agitation is affecting your day-to-day life—are you able to do your usual activities, or is it interfering in any way?

**Patient**: I'm still able to do my usual activities. The nervousness and agitation are noticeable, but they haven't really interfered with my daily routine.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you've been experiencing some mild and persistent feelings of nervousness and agitation, but without any clear physical symptoms or changes in your daily functioning. Since you haven't noticed any major changes in your routine, mood, or energy, and you're still able to go about your usual activities, what you're describing often falls under what's called mild situational anxiety. This can happen even without an obvious trigger—sometimes our bodies and minds react to subtle stresses or changes we might not immediately recognize.

The good news is that these kinds of symptoms are common and often resolve on their own. It's helpful to pay attention to your sleep, regular exercise, and any caffeine or medication use, as these can sometimes contribute. If the feelings persist, worsen, or start interfering with your life, it would be important to let me know so we can explore other causes or consider additional support.

For now, focusing on relaxation techniques like deep breathing, staying active, and keeping a regular routine can be beneficial. If anything changes or you notice new symptoms—such as trouble sleeping, changes in appetite, persistent low mood, or physical symptoms—please reach out. Does that sound reasonable to you?

**Patient**: That sounds reasonable to me. I appreciate you explaining it—it's good to know this is pretty common. I'll keep an eye on things and let you know if anything changes or gets worse.
