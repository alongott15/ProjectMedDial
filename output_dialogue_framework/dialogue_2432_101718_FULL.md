## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks logical, relevant questions about the palpitations, fever, and postoperative course, and the patient provides plausible answers. The doctor's explanation and reassurance are appropriate for a light, common case with no alarming symptoms. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders are introduced. The conversation is coherent and role-appropriate.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce unsupported symptoms or details. For even greater realism, the patient could specify the timing of surgery if known, or ask a follow-up question about when to seek help.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and provides appropriate reassurance. For improvement, the doctor could briefly mention any plans for follow-up or clarify if any further evaluation (e.g., EKG) might be considered if symptoms persist.

**Conversation Flow**: The dialogue flows logically, with each question building on prior answers. The summary and reassurance at the end are clear and appropriate. Consider a closing statement about scheduling or next steps.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns are present. The advice to monitor for worsening symptoms is clear and appropriate for this scenario.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having these occasional palpitations—my heart just feels like it's skipping or fluttering sometimes. That's mainly why I wanted to get checked out.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about some related symptoms—have you noticed any chills, sweating, or changes in your temperature when these palpitations occur?

**Patient**: I did have a fever after my surgery—it got pretty high at first, up to 103, then it settled down to more of a low grade, around 100.7. I haven't really noticed chills or sweating with the palpitations, though.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have these palpitations been happening at specific times, like during activity, when you're resting, or perhaps at night?

**Patient**: Most of the time, the palpitations happen when I’m just sitting still or resting. I haven’t noticed them getting worse with activity or at night.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your recovery after surgery—how long ago was your surgery, and have you had any other symptoms along with the low-grade fever, like new pain, redness, or swelling at the surgical site?

**Patient**: I’m not sure exactly how long it’s been since the surgery, maybe a few weeks. I haven’t had any new pain, redness, or swelling at the site—just the fever that started high and then stayed low grade.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall energy—have you felt more tired than usual since these symptoms began, or has your energy level stayed about the same?

**Patient**: My energy level has mostly stayed the same. I haven’t felt unusually tired since these symptoms started.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the fever—has your temperature returned completely to normal now, or do you still notice it running a bit high at times?

**Patient**: My temperature still runs a little bit high at times—it hasn’t gone all the way back to normal yet.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask—when you feel these palpitations, do you ever experience lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort along with them?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort with the palpitations. It’s just the fluttering feeling.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did the fever first start after your surgery, and how long did it stay at its highest before settling down to the low-grade level?

**Patient**: The fever started not long after my surgery, but I don’t remember the exact day. It was at its highest for maybe a day or two before dropping to the low-grade level.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your palpitations are occurring at rest and aren't accompanied by concerning symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath. Your energy level has stayed stable, and you haven't noticed any issues at your surgical site. Palpitations like these are often benign, especially when there are no other warning signs.

Sometimes, after surgery and during recovery, changes in your body's stress hormones or mild shifts in hydration can trigger occasional fluttering sensations in the heart. Low-grade temperatures can also linger for a while postoperatively as your body heals.

What’s important is that you’re not experiencing severe symptoms. If the palpitations become more frequent, last longer, or start coming with dizziness or chest discomfort, those would be reasons to check in sooner. For now, monitoring your symptoms and staying hydrated is wise. If your temperature remains above normal for much longer, or if anything changes at the surgical site, let your healthcare team know.

Does this help clarify what might be going on?

**Patient**: Thanks, that does help clear things up. I’ll keep an eye on the palpitations and my temperature like you suggested. It’s good to know these symptoms aren’t too concerning right now.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 40-year-old male presenting with occasional palpitations and no shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion. He has a history of mitral regurgitation, previously diagnosed murmur, hemorrhoids, and an old left wrist fracture. The patient was admitted for mitral valve regurgitation and underwent mitral valve repair, which he tolerated well. Postoperatively, he experienced a transient fever (up to 103°F) and mild right lower lobe atelectasis but otherwise recovered without significant complications. On discharge, his physical exam was stable with a patent murmur and clear lungs. The documented diagnosis was status post mitral valve repair. Discharge instructions included use of incentive spirometry, increased ambulation, coughing to clear mucus, and follow-up in three to four weeks; medications prescribed were Percocet, acetaminophen, Lopressor, and Ultram.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with the chief complaint of occasional palpitations described as a fluttering or skipping sensation, mainly occurring at rest. The palpitations are not associated with chest discomfort, dyspnea, lightheadedness, chills, or sweating. The patient reports a postoperative fever that initially reached 103°F, then settled to a low-grade level around 100.7°F, persisting intermittently for several weeks after surgery; there are no new symptoms at the surgical site and energy level remains stable. Relevant history includes recent surgery a few weeks prior. The clinical impression is that the palpitations are likely benign and related to postoperative recovery, with no current warning signs. The treatment plan includes monitoring symptoms, maintaining hydration, and seeking further evaluation if palpitations worsen or are accompanied by new symptoms such as dizziness or chest discomfort. The patient was also advised to report persistent fever or any changes at the surgical site.
