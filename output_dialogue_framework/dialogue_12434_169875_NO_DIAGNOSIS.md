## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about gait changes, fall risk, and associated symptoms, and provides reasonable reassurance and safety advice. The patient responses are coherent and align with the documented symptoms (ataxic gait, unsteadiness, 1+ edema in the left foot). No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced. The conversation remains at a primary-care level and avoids unnecessary escalation.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and brings up a new but documented symptom (left foot swelling) at the end. For further realism, the patient could mention how long the swelling has been present or if it fluctuates.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and addresses safety. For completeness, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the reported left foot swelling at the end, even if just to say it will be discussed further.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with each question building on prior answers. The transition to discussing the swelling is smooth. Consider closing with a summary or explicit next steps for added clarity.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No major safety concerns. The doctor appropriately advises on red-flag symptoms and fall prevention. Addressing the left foot edema more directly would improve thoroughness.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been feeling a bit concerned because I was told I have a cerebral aneurysm. That's mainly why I'm here today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any changes you've noticed recently—have you had any trouble with your balance or walking, such as feeling unsteady or having an ataxic gait?

**Patient**: Yes, I've noticed some changes with my walking. I feel a bit unsteady, and my gait has been off lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this is affecting your day-to-day life. Are you able to do your usual activities around the house, or has the unsteadiness made things more difficult for you?

**Patient**: It's definitely made things more difficult. I find it harder to get around the house and do what I normally do because of the unsteadiness.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when these changes began—do you recall how long you've been feeling unsteady, and has it been gradually worsening or staying about the same?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it began, but the unsteadiness seems to have gotten a bit worse over time. I just started noticing it more in my daily activities.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, or weakness in your arms or legs along with the unsteadiness?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any headaches, vision changes, or weakness in my arms or legs. It's mainly just the unsteady walking.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you feel unsteady, does it tend to happen more at certain times of day or in specific situations, like getting up quickly or walking on uneven surfaces?

**Patient**: It doesn't seem tied to a certain time of day. I notice the unsteadiness more when I'm moving around, especially if I'm on an uneven surface.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you're walking, do you ever feel like you might fall, or have you actually lost your balance to the point of falling recently?

**Patient**: I do feel like I might fall sometimes, but I haven’t actually fallen yet. The unsteadiness just makes me more cautious when I’m walking.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your walking—do you find that your steps are more wide-based or do you have trouble starting or stopping when you walk?

**Patient**: My steps are definitely more wide-based now. I don’t really have trouble starting or stopping, it’s just that my gait feels off and unsteady.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your walking has become more unsteady over time, and you're adapting by widening your steps to help keep your balance. This kind of change in gait—especially if it's gradually getting worse—can sometimes be related to issues in the brain, such as the cerebral aneurysm you mentioned, but it can also be caused by other factors like changes in strength, sensation, or even certain medications.

Since you're not experiencing other symptoms like headaches, vision changes, or limb weakness, that's somewhat reassuring. However, because your unsteadiness is affecting your daily activities and increasing your risk of falling, it's important to address this. Often, people find that using supportive footwear, clearing clutter at home, and considering physical therapy for balance can help reduce fall risk.

If you notice new symptoms—such as sudden severe headache, double vision, trouble speaking, or weakness—those would be important to report right away. For now, I'd recommend focusing on safety at home and possibly discussing a referral for physical therapy or a further evaluation with your neurologist. Let me know if you have questions or concerns about these suggestions.

**Patient**: Okay, that makes sense. I’ll try to be more careful at home and would be open to physical therapy if you think it will help. Also, I’ve noticed some mild swelling in my left foot—should I be concerned about that too?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 65-year-old female presenting with a cerebral aneurysm. She reported no headache, vision problems, weakness, or paresthesias, but did note changes in her gait. Her past medical history includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; she is allergic to penicillin, Keflex, and Bactrim. On examination, she was frail but in no acute distress, with positive rales on chest exam and an ataxic gait. The documented diagnosis was cerebral aneurysm. She underwent successful coiling of the aneurysm and remained neurologically stable postoperatively. Post-procedure care included hourly neurological checks and heparin to maintain her PTT in the 50-60 range. She was discharged in stable condition.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with concern regarding a known cerebral aneurysm. They reported a gradually worsening unsteady gait, describing increased difficulty with walking, especially on uneven surfaces, and needing to take wider steps to maintain balance; the unsteadiness has made daily activities more difficult but has not resulted in falls. The patient denied headaches, vision changes, or weakness in the arms or legs, and noted that the unsteadiness is not tied to a specific time of day. Relevant history includes the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysm; no medications or allergies were mentioned. On clinical questioning, the patient described a wide-based gait and increased caution due to fear of falling, but no actual falls. The doctor assessed that the unsteady gait could be related to the cerebral aneurysm or other factors such as changes in strength, sensation, or medications, but found it reassuring that there were no additional neurological symptoms. The doctor recommended focusing on home safety (supportive footwear, clearing clutter), considering physical therapy for balance, and monitoring for new symptoms such as sudden severe headache, double vision, speech trouble, or weakness. The patient also mentioned mild swelling in the left foot at the end of the visit.
