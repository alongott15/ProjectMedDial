## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is realistic and consistent with the patient's profile and presenting symptoms. The doctor asks appropriate, open-ended questions about the wound and associated symptoms, and the patient provides plausible, relevant responses. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events introduced. The conversation is focused on gathering information about the wound and related symptoms, which is appropriate for a primary care setting. The simulation ends due to a technical issue, not a content problem.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could provide more detail about the bleeding (e.g., frequency of dressing changes) if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's questions are thorough and well-sequenced. For improvement, could briefly acknowledge the patient's concern or provide reassurance before moving to detailed questions.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural. The simulation ends abruptly due to a technical issue; otherwise, the conversation would likely have continued smoothly.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns in the dialogue as presented. The doctor appropriately screens for infection and bleeding severity.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me what's been going on and how it's affecting your daily life?

**Patient**: I've noticed there's been some discharge coming from my surgical wound, and it's making me a bit concerned. It's been affecting my day-to-day—I find myself checking it a lot and feeling a little uneasy about it.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discharge—when did you first notice it, and has it changed in amount or appearance since then?

**Patient**: I first noticed the discharge a few days ago. I think it's gotten a bit more noticeable since then, and the smell seems stronger now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other changes—have you noticed redness, swelling, or warmth around the area, or have you had any fever or chills? Sometimes these can help us figure out if there's an infection starting.

**Patient**: There's been some swelling in both of my legs, up to the knees, and I've also noticed some bleeding from the groin wound. I haven't had any fever or chills, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. Can you describe how much bleeding you've seen—would you say it's just a spot on the bandage, or is it soaking through and requiring frequent changes? This helps me gauge how significant the bleeding might be.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 70-year-old female presenting with discharge from a surgical wound in the left groin. She reported increasing drainage and bleeding from the wound, which was found to be dehisced and draining serous, foul-smelling fluid; she remained afebrile but developed an elevated white blood cell count postoperatively. Her relevant history includes recent bilateral distal external iliac and common femoral artery endarterectomies with patch angioplasties, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, tobacco use, and right renal artery stenosis. The documented diagnosis was wound dehiscence with graft rupture, status post exploration ilial-femoral bypass with graft placement and wound debridement. Treatment included urgent surgical intervention (left groin exploration, bypass grafting, ligation, and debridement), intravenous antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin), followed by oral Flagyl and Lobaplatin, blood transfusions, and wound care with sterile dressings. Infectious Disease consultation guided antibiotic therapy based on wound cultures, which grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli. The patient was discharged in stable condition to rehabilitation with instructions for ongoing wound care and follow-up in two weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with concern regarding discharge from a surgical wound. The discharge was first noticed a few days ago and has since increased in amount and developed a stronger odor.

The bleeding has been significant enough to be noticed, though the exact amount is not specified. Relevant medical history, medications, and allergies are not documented in this dialogue. No formal diagnosis is documented at this stage. The doctor is gathering further details to assess the severity of the bleeding and possible infection. No specific treatment or recommendations have been provided yet.
