## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about ostomy output, consistency, associated symptoms, hydration status, diet, and skin condition. The patient responses are clear and match the profile. The doctor's reasoning and advice are grounded in the symptoms described, with no unsupported diagnoses or interventions. The conversation stays within the bounds of a light, common case and avoids introducing severe complications or unnecessary tests.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could specify the exact onset of symptoms if possible, but uncertainty is realistic.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor provides thorough assessment and clear advice. To improve, the doctor could briefly mention the existing diagnosis of partial small bowel obstruction for context, and clarify when to seek urgent care (e.g., persistent vomiting or signs of obstruction).

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between topics. The summary and advice at the end are well-placed. Consider slightly shortening the final summary to avoid repetition.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns detected. The doctor appropriately emphasizes monitoring for dehydration and escalation if symptoms worsen. Advice is clear and matches the mild nature of the case.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in today. What brings you in—have you noticed any changes or concerns with your ostomy recently?

**Patient**: I've noticed my ostomy output has really increased lately, and that's got me a bit concerned.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the consistency—has the texture of your ostomy output changed as well, or is it just the amount that's different?

**Patient**: Yes, the consistency has changed too. It used to be like mashed potatoes, but now it's more liquid.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when this started—have you noticed these changes over the past few days, or has it been going on longer?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly, but I think it's been going on for a few days now.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like stomach cramps, fever, or feeling more tired than usual? Sometimes these can help us figure out if there's an underlying cause for the change.

**Patient**: I have had some nausea and even a bit of vomiting with the higher output. I haven't noticed any fever or unusual tiredness, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you've had some nausea and vomiting, have you been able to keep fluids down, or are you starting to feel dehydrated—like having a dry mouth, feeling lightheaded, or noticing less urine?

**Patient**: I’ve been able to keep fluids down so far, and I haven’t noticed a dry mouth or feeling lightheaded. My urine seems about the same, so I don’t think I’m dehydrated at this point.

**Doctor**: Got it. Are you eating and drinking about the same as usual, or have there been any recent changes to your diet or any new foods introduced? Sometimes what we eat can affect ostomy output.

**Patient**: I’ve been eating and drinking about the same as usual—no new foods or big changes in my diet lately.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any skin irritation or soreness around your stoma since the output changed? Sometimes increased liquid can affect the skin, and it's helpful to catch any issues early.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any skin irritation or soreness around my stoma since the change. The area looks about the same as usual.

**Doctor**: Okay. Does the increased output seem to happen more at certain times of day, or is it pretty constant throughout the day and night?

**Patient**: The increased output is pretty constant throughout the day and night. I haven’t noticed any specific pattern or time when it’s worse.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your ostomy output has become more liquid and increased in volume over the past few days, with some nausea and vomiting but no signs of dehydration or skin irritation. Often, these kinds of changes can be triggered by a mild stomach upset, a short-lived infection, or sometimes even just a temporary change in how your gut is working—even if your diet hasn't changed.

Because you're able to keep fluids down and aren't feeling weak or dizzy, this isn't immediately concerning, but it's important to keep an eye on things. If the output stays high or increases, or if you start to feel signs of dehydration (like dry mouth, dark urine, or dizziness), that's a reason to seek care promptly.

Let me ask—how much is this affecting your day-to-day life right now? Are you finding it hard to keep up with your usual activities?

**Patient**: I can still do most of my usual activities, but I’m having to pay more attention to the ostomy and take breaks when I feel nauseated. It’s a bit inconvenient, but not stopping me completely.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, it sounds like your body is handling this change reasonably well so far, since you're staying hydrated and keeping up with most activities. When ostomy output becomes more liquid and increases, it’s often due to a minor gut upset, a short-lived virus, or sometimes even stress on the digestive tract. The main concerns are making sure you don’t get dehydrated and watching for any signs of infection or blockage.

Right now, you’re doing the most important thing—monitoring your fluid intake and keeping an eye on your urine output. If you start to notice darker urine, feel lightheaded, or can’t keep fluids down, those would be signs to reach out for care sooner.

In the meantime, you might find that eating smaller, more frequent meals and including foods that help thicken output—like bananas, rice, or applesauce—can sometimes help. It’s also good to keep track of how much you’re emptying and any new symptoms.

If things don’t improve in the next few days, or if your nausea gets worse, it would be a good idea to check in with your healthcare team. Does that make sense, or is there anything else you’re worried about right now?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 44-year-old female presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She reported intermittent upper then lower abdominal pain (worst intensity 8/10), associated with at least 10 episodes of vomiting (initially clear, then bilious) and no blood, beginning the day prior to admission. Her history is significant for ulcerative colitis status post proctocolectomy with ileostomy, multiple prior small bowel obstructions, GERD, depression, frequent UTIs, and allergies to Flagyl, Bactrim, and Reglan. Imaging and clinical evaluation revealed a small bowel obstruction likely due to adhesions. She underwent exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions, small bowel resection with primary anastomosis, and small bowel repairs, followed by a period of ICU care and gradual recovery. Postoperatively, she required TPN, IV fluids, loperamide for high ostomy output, wound care for a surgical site infection, and was transitioned to a low residue diet as tolerated. At discharge, her condition was stable with controlled pain, adequate oral intake, and instructions for wound and ostomy care, medication management, and follow-up were provided.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with increased ostomy output as the chief complaint. Over the past few days, the patient has experienced a change in ostomy output consistency from mashed potato-like to more liquid, with increased volume that is constant throughout the day and night. Associated symptoms include nausea and occasional vomiting, but there are no signs of dehydration (such as dry mouth, lightheadedness, or decreased urine output) and no skin irritation around the stoma. The patient denies recent dietary changes and reports being able to maintain most usual activities, though with some inconvenience due to nausea.

The clinical impression is that the increased, more liquid ostomy output is likely due to a mild gastrointestinal upset, a short-lived infection, or a temporary change in gut function. The treatment plan includes monitoring fluid intake and urine output for signs of dehydration, eating smaller and more frequent meals, and considering foods that may help thicken ostomy output (such as bananas, rice, or applesauce). The patient is advised to seek care if symptoms worsen, dehydration develops, or if there is no improvement within a few days. No new medications or interventions were prescribed at this time.
