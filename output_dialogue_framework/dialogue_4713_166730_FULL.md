## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about exertional chest heaviness and arm pain, explores associated symptoms (shortness of breath, lightheadedness), and provides a reasonable preliminary assessment (exertional angina) given the history of multivessel coronary artery disease. The patient responses are coherent and match the described symptoms. The plan for basic cardiac testing is appropriate for a light, common case. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient could mention all relevant symptoms earlier (e.g., paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, claudication) to help the doctor get a fuller picture sooner.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor could explicitly ask about nocturnal symptoms (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), edema, and any recent procedures/incision issues to fully address the profile. A brief review of other cardiovascular risk factors or medication adherence would add realism.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with clear transitions between symptom exploration and explanation. Could be improved by summarizing all symptoms before moving to recommendations.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate. Doctor could clarify what symptoms warrant urgent attention (e.g., chest pain at rest, fainting) with more emphasis. No major safety or clarity concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about any symptoms or concerns you've been having lately?

**Patient**: I've been getting this heavy feeling in my chest whenever I do something active, like walking or going up stairs. It's been bothering me lately and I wanted to get it checked out.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when this started—how long have you been noticing this heavy sensation during activity?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly, but I think it's been going on for a couple of weeks now. It seems to happen whenever I try to be more active.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other sensations—do you ever notice discomfort spreading to your arms, neck, or jaw when this happens?

**Patient**: Yes, I do get pain in my arm along with the chest heaviness. I haven't noticed it spreading to my neck or jaw, though.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long the discomfort lasts—does it go away quickly when you rest, or does it linger even after you stop being active?

**Patient**: Resting usually helps and the heaviness goes away after I stop moving around. It doesn’t really linger much once I sit down.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you ever felt short of breath, sweaty, or lightheaded when this happens, or is it mostly just the heaviness and arm discomfort?

**Patient**: Yes, I do get short of breath when it happens, and sometimes I feel a bit lightheaded too. Sweating isn’t really an issue for me.

**Doctor**: Alright. How intense would you say the discomfort gets at its worst—would you rate it as mild, moderate, or severe?

**Patient**: I’d call it moderate. It’s uncomfortable enough to slow me down, but not so bad that I have to stop right away.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your activities—does this sensation ever come on when you’re resting, or does it only happen during physical effort?

**Patient**: No, it only happens when I’m doing something physical. I don’t get that heaviness or arm pain while resting.

**Doctor**: Based on what you've described, I'd like to know—has this heavy feeling or shortness of breath been getting better, worse, or staying about the same since you first noticed it?

**Patient**: It’s been pretty much the same since I first noticed it. I also get short of breath when I’m active, and sometimes I have trouble breathing at night too.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, it sounds like your symptoms are brought on by activity and improve with rest, which can sometimes suggest that your heart isn't getting quite enough oxygen during exertion—a pattern we call "exertional angina." The fact that you also experience shortness of breath at night could mean your heart is working a bit harder than usual. These symptoms aren't uncommon in people your age, but they are important to check out because they can be early warning signs of heart-related issues.

While your symptoms have stayed about the same, it's a good idea to avoid strenuous activities until we know more. I recommend we arrange for some basic heart tests—such as an EKG and possibly a stress test—to get a clearer picture. In the meantime, if you ever develop chest discomfort at rest, severe shortness of breath, or feel faint, those would be reasons to seek immediate medical attention.

Let me know if you have any questions about what we've discussed or if you'd like more details on what to expect next.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I do get some light-headed episodes now and then, and I’ve noticed pain in my legs when I walk for a while—maybe that’s claudication? I appreciate you setting up the tests; I’ll take it easy until then.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 58-year-old male presenting with two months of exertional chest heaviness and arm pain, as well as episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, dyspnea on exertion, light-headedness, claudication, and edema. Symptoms were noted during physical activity, specifically while remodeling his kitchen, and he also reported right lower back pain. His past medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic back pain, and a prior transient ischemic attack. Cardiac evaluation revealed multivessel coronary artery disease following abnormal stress test findings. The documented diagnosis was multivessel coronary artery disease. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG x5) and had an uncomplicated postoperative course with gradual improvement and physical therapy. Discharge medications included aspirin, Lasix, isosorbide dinitrate, Lopressor, and other supportive therapies. The patient was discharged in stable condition with instructions for follow-up care and home physical therapy services.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with a chief complaint of chest heaviness during physical activity. Symptoms include a moderate, activity-induced heavy sensation in the chest accompanied by arm pain, shortness of breath, and occasional lightheadedness, all of which resolve with rest; the symptoms have been present for a couple of weeks and remain unchanged. The patient also reports nocturnal shortness of breath and intermittent leg pain with walking. No chest discomfort occurs at rest, and there is no associated sweating. Relevant history, medications, and allergies are not specified. The clinical impression documented by the doctor is exertional angina, possibly indicating reduced cardiac oxygen supply during exertion. The treatment plan includes avoiding strenuous activities, arranging for an EKG and possibly a stress test, and instructions to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or occur at rest.
