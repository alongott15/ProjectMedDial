## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue closely follows the patient's reported symptoms and history, with the doctor asking logical, relevant follow-up questions about fever, surgical site changes, and general recovery. The reasoning is consistent with a mild post-surgical complication, and the advice to contact the surgical team is appropriate. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced. The conversation is clear, respectful, and plausible for a primary-care setting.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and appropriately detailed. For improvement, the patient could mention any medications currently being taken or allergies if asked, but this is not necessary given the context.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor provides thorough, stepwise reasoning and explains clinical thinking well. For improvement, could briefly clarify what a TRAM flap is for lay understanding if appropriate, and explicitly ask about other infection signs (e.g., chills, malaise) earlier.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and smooth, with each question building on previous answers. The summary and advice at the end are well-placed. For improvement, a brief recap of key findings before giving advice could reinforce understanding.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety is maintained by advising prompt contact with the surgical team rather than managing alone. Clarity is high; all explanations are accessible. No concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hi, it’s good to see you today. What’s been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been running a fever since my TRAM flap surgery, and it's got me a little concerned.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the fever—when did it first start after your surgery, and have you noticed any other new symptoms like chills, redness, or swelling at the surgical site?

**Patient**: It started a couple of days after the surgery. My fever's gone up to about 101, but I haven't noticed any chills or redness.

**Doctor**: Got it. Besides the fever, have you experienced any general body aches, increased fatigue, or changes in how your surgical site feels—like warmth, tenderness, or drainage? These details can help me understand if there might be an infection or just a normal post-surgical reaction.

**Patient**: I've had some body aches and the area feels more sore and there's pressure, especially in the lower part of my breast and abdomen. I haven't noticed any drainage, though.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your recovery overall—have you been able to move around and eat normally since the surgery, or have you had any trouble with appetite, nausea, or getting out of bed? This helps me gauge how much the soreness and pressure are affecting you day-to-day.

**Patient**: I’ve still been able to eat and get around, just a bit slower because of the soreness. I haven’t had any nausea or problems with my appetite.

**Doctor**: Alright. Does the soreness or pressure seem to be getting worse, staying the same, or improving over time? This can help distinguish between normal healing and something that might need closer attention.

**Patient**: The soreness and pressure have actually gotten a bit worse over the last day or so. It’s more noticeable now than it was right after the surgery.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you checked your temperature at different times of the day, and if so, does your fever come and go or is it fairly constant? This can help me understand how your body is responding and whether the fever pattern suggests normal healing or something that needs closer follow-up.

**Patient**: I’ve checked a few times throughout the day, and the fever seems to stick around—doesn’t really go away. Thanks for explaining what you’re looking for; I appreciate it.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discomfort—if you gently press on the area that feels sore or under pressure, does it feel especially tender or firm compared to the rest of your breast or abdomen? This can help me figure out if there’s swelling or a collection under the skin, which sometimes happens after surgery.

**Patient**: Yes, it does feel more tender and firm in that lower area compared to the rest. The pressure is definitely more noticeable there.

**Doctor**: Okay. Has the firmness or tenderness spread to a larger area, or is it staying in one spot? This detail helps me figure out if there might be a localized issue developing after your surgery.

**Patient**: It’s really just staying in that one spot, hasn’t spread to a bigger area. The firmness and tenderness are mostly in the lower part of my breast and abdomen.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re experiencing a persistent fever and increasing firmness and soreness in a specific area after your surgery. After procedures like a TRAM flap, some discomfort and swelling are expected as part of healing. However, when the area becomes more tender and firm over time—especially with a constant fever—it can sometimes indicate a localized infection or a fluid collection under the skin.

What often happens in these cases is that bacteria can get into the surgical site, or a pocket of fluid can develop, both of which can cause the symptoms you’re describing. While you haven’t noticed redness or drainage, the worsening discomfort and fever are worth paying attention to.

My advice is to contact your surgical team promptly so they can examine the area. They may want to check for signs of infection or other complications and decide if any treatment is needed. In the meantime, keep monitoring your temperature and look out for new symptoms like spreading redness, drainage, chills, or feeling generally unwell.

Let me know if you notice any changes or if you have questions about what to watch for.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that—it helps to know what might be going on. I’ll reach out to my surgical team about the fever and the increased soreness and pressure. If anything else changes, I’ll make sure to let you know.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 48-year-old female presenting with fever following a right free TRAM flap procedure performed on 2145-5-3. She reported a fever up to 101°F and generalized aches for one day, along with increased soreness and pressure in the lower aspect of her breast and abdomen; she denied chest pain, dyspnea, urinary symptoms, leg swelling, or cough. Her past medical history includes breast cancer status post mastectomy and right free TRAM flap reconstruction. Physical exam revealed a clean, intact right breast flap with normal capillary refill and minimal drainage, and an abdominal incision with minimal tenderness. Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis (WBC 22.9) and moderate leukocytes in urine, but no evidence of urinary tract infection. The documented diagnosis was infected hematoma/seroma at the surgical site. Treatment included wound washout of the right breast and administration of intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole. She has allergies to morphine, gadolinium-containing agents, and vancomycin.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with persistent fever following TRAM flap surgery. She reported the fever began a couple of days postoperatively, reaching up to 101°F, and described associated body aches, increased soreness, and pressure localized to the lower part of her breast and abdomen; she denied chills, redness, drainage, nausea, or appetite changes. The soreness and pressure have worsened over the past day and are accompanied by increased tenderness and firmness in the same area, without spreading. She has been able to eat and move around, albeit more slowly due to discomfort. The doctor noted the combination of constant fever and increasing localized tenderness and firmness may indicate a possible infection or fluid collection at the surgical site, although some postoperative discomfort is expected. The doctor advised the patient to promptly contact her surgical team for further evaluation and to continue monitoring her temperature and watch for new symptoms such as spreading redness, drainage, chills, or feeling generally unwell. No medication allergies or other relevant medical history were mentioned.
