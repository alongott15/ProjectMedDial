## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and symptoms. The doctor appropriately explores the exertional nature of the heartburn and tiredness, considers cardiac causes given the patient's history, and gives clear, cautious advice without overstepping the case type. There are no unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments introduced. The conversation is logical, respectful, and avoids unnecessary repetition.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and describes symptoms well. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any attempts at self-management (e.g., antacids) or clarify if there are any associated symptoms like nausea or palpitations.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For completeness, the doctor could briefly ask about any recent medication changes, dietary triggers, or GI bleeding symptoms given the patient's history.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is natural and sequential, with each question building on prior answers. The summary and safety netting at the end are appropriate.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate for a light case with significant cardiac history. The doctor avoids alarming language but emphasizes when to seek urgent care. No safety concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What’s been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been getting heartburn when I try to do things around the house, like walking or going up the stairs. It's been bothering me more lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long this has been going on—did these symptoms just start recently, or have you noticed them for a while?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been going on for a few weeks now. It seems like it's getting a bit more noticeable lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this is impacting your usual routine—are you having to stop or slow down more than usual because of these episodes?

**Patient**: Yes, I've noticed I have to slow down more than I used to. I get tired more easily when I'm active, and the heartburn seems to make it harder to keep going.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—when you feel this discomfort, do you ever notice chest tightness, shortness of breath, or sweating along with it?

**Patient**: I haven’t had any chest tightness, shortness of breath, or sweating with it. The main thing is the heartburn and just feeling more tired when I’m active.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you get this discomfort, does it ever happen when you’re resting, or is it only when you’re moving around and being active?

**Patient**: It only seems to come on when I'm moving around or doing something active. I don't really notice it when I'm just sitting or resting.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much does this bother you on a typical day—are you able to finish your activities, or do you have to stop and rest until the feeling passes?

**Patient**: I usually have to stop and rest until the heartburn and tiredness ease up. It does get in the way of finishing what I want to do.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what helps—when you rest, does the discomfort go away quickly, or does it linger for a while?

**Patient**: Resting helps, and the discomfort usually goes away pretty quickly once I stop what I’m doing. It doesn’t really linger for long.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you ever had similar symptoms in the past, or is this the first time you’ve experienced this kind of discomfort with activity?

**Patient**: This is the first time I’ve had this kind of heartburn and tiredness when I’m active. It hasn’t happened to me before like this.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your discomfort and tiredness only come on when you're active and improve quickly with rest. Sometimes, what feels like heartburn with activity can actually be a sign of your heart not getting enough oxygen during exertion—especially since this is new for you and affecting your ability to do daily tasks.

While heartburn is often related to stomach acid, the fact that it’s brought on by exertion and goes away with rest makes me want to be cautious. In people your age, these symptoms can sometimes be a warning sign of angina, which is reduced blood flow to the heart.

I recommend that you avoid strenuous activity for now and arrange to see your primary care provider soon for further evaluation. If you develop any chest pain, pressure, shortness of breath, or if the discomfort comes on at rest or becomes more severe, seek medical attention right away.

For now, try to note any patterns or triggers, and let your doctor know about any changes. It’s important to get this checked to rule out anything serious.

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining all that. I’ll make sure to take it easy and set up an appointment with my doctor soon. I appreciate your help—I'll keep an eye out for any changes like you said.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 66-year-old male presenting with exertional heartburn and fatigue. He was found to have a low hematocrit and an upper GI bleed due to a polyp, which was treated with polypectomy, after which he stabilized. He subsequently had a positive stress test and was transferred for further cardiac evaluation. His relevant history includes paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, carotid endarterectomy, GI bleed, transient ischemic attacks, and renal calculi; he has no known drug allergies. Cardiac catheterization revealed multi-vessel coronary artery disease, and he underwent a four-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Postoperatively, he recovered well, was weaned from the ventilator, and tolerated physical therapy. The documented diagnoses include paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, carotid disease status post endarterectomy, GI bleed, questionable TIAs, renal calculi, and coronary artery disease status post CABG x4. He was discharged home in stable condition with medications including Lasix, Lopressor, glipizide, Lipitor, potassium chloride, Colace, aspirin, Zantac, and Percocet, and instructed to follow up with his primary care physician and cardiologist.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with exertional heartburn as the chief complaint. Symptoms include heartburn and increased tiredness that occur only during physical activity (such as walking or climbing stairs), have been present for several weeks, are worsening, and resolve quickly with rest; there is no associated chest tightness, shortness of breath, or sweating. The patient reports having to stop and rest during activities due to these symptoms, which are new and have not occurred previously. No relevant past medical history, medications, or allergies are specified.

The clinical impression is that the exertional heartburn may represent angina (reduced blood flow to the heart) rather than typical gastrointestinal reflux, given its activity-related onset and relief with rest. The patient was advised to avoid strenuous activity and to arrange prompt follow-up with their primary care provider for further evaluation. Additional instructions included monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms such as chest pain, pressure, shortness of breath, or symptoms occurring at rest, and to seek immediate medical attention if these develop. The importance of noting symptom patterns and communicating changes to their doctor was emphasized.
