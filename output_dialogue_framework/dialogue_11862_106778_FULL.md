## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile and the case type. The doctor asks logical, stepwise questions about the pain, location, associated symptoms, possible trauma, impact on function, and home management. The patient responses are plausible and relevant. The doctor's summary and explanation are appropriate for a mild case of cellulitis/hematoma, and no unsupported diagnoses or treatments are introduced. The conversation is clear, avoids role confusion, and maintains a realistic tone.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any other symptoms (e.g., fever, chills) if present or explicitly deny them.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and clear. To further improve, the doctor could ask about systemic symptoms (fever, chills) or anticoagulant use given the patient's cardiac history, but this is not strictly necessary for a light case.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural. The transition from symptom inquiry to explanation is smooth. Consider adding a closing statement or plan for next steps to round out the encounter.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The explanation is appropriate for the case type and avoids unsupported content.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain in your left leg—does it feel constant, or does it come and go throughout the day?

**Patient**: The pain in my left leg is pretty much always there, it doesn't really let up much during the day. It’s worse when I try to move around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the area that's bothering you—can you point to exactly where the pain is located? Is it mostly around the spot where you noticed the bruising, or does it spread to other parts of your leg?

**Patient**: The pain is mainly right where the big bruise is on my left shin. It doesn’t really spread much beyond that area.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any swelling, warmth, or redness around the bruise, or is it mainly just the discoloration and discomfort?

**Patient**: Yes, there’s swelling and redness around the bruise, and the area feels a bit warm to the touch. The skin looks pretty red and puffy where the hematoma is.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more question—have you had any recent injuries or bumps to your left shin that might have caused the bruise and swelling, or did it seem to appear on its own?

**Patient**: I don’t remember hitting it or injuring my shin. The bruise and swelling just sort of showed up without any clear reason.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily routine—has this pain and swelling made it difficult for you to walk or do regular activities around the house?

**Patient**: Yes, it’s made it hard for me to get around the house. Walking is pretty tough because of the pain and swelling in my leg.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what you’ve tried so far—have you done anything at home, like using ice, elevating your leg, or taking any pain relievers? If so, did any of those seem to help with the discomfort or swelling?

**Patient**: I've tried keeping my leg elevated and took some pain medication like Vicodin. Elevating it helps a little with the swelling, but the discomfort is still there. I haven’t used ice.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you have a localized area of swelling, redness, and warmth in your left shin that started without a clear injury. The fact that it's making it difficult for you to walk and hasn't improved much with elevation and pain medication is important.

What often happens with bruises or hematomas is that they result from minor trauma, but when there's no obvious injury and the area is red, swollen, and warm, we want to make sure there's not an infection developing under the skin—something called cellulitis. Another possibility is that blood pooled under the skin (hematoma) is causing inflammation.

Let me ask: On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the discomfort in your leg right now? This helps gauge how much it's affecting you and guides what steps might be needed next.

**Patient**: Right now, I’d rate the discomfort at about a 7 out of 10. I appreciate you explaining what could be going on. Is there anything else I should be doing to help it heal?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 69-year-old male presenting with left lower extremity cellulitis and hematoma. He developed a progressively enlarging hematoma on his left shin after bumping it with a suitcase six days prior to admission, followed by localized shin pain but no distal weakness, sensory deficits, fever, or chills. His past medical history includes congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease status post CABG, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and other cardiac interventions. On presentation, he was afebrile with stable vital signs. The clinical impression was left lower extremity cellulitis with associated hematoma in the setting of anticoagulation. He was started on intravenous Ancef after blood cultures were obtained. Prior to admission, he had been treated with oral Keflex and Vicodin for pain, and his Coumadin dose was recently decreased due to a supratherapeutic INR.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with persistent pain in the left leg, primarily localized to the area of a large bruise on the left shin. The pain is constant throughout the day, worsens with movement, and is associated with swelling, redness, warmth, and difficulty walking; the discomfort was rated as 7 out of 10 in severity. The patient denied any known injury or trauma to the area and reported that the symptoms appeared without a clear cause. The patient has tried elevating the leg and taking Vicodin for pain, which provided minimal relief; ice has not been used. On examination, the doctor noted localized swelling, redness, and warmth over the hematoma. The doctor’s assessment included concern for possible cellulitis or inflammation from a hematoma, given the absence of trauma and presence of localized symptoms. The doctor explained these possibilities to the patient and emphasized monitoring for infection. No additional specific treatment recommendations were provided during this portion of the discussion.
