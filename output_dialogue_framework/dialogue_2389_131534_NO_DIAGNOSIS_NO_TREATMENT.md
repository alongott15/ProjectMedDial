## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and presents a plausible, stepwise clinical reasoning process for a mild case involving epistaxis, hematemesis, and mild GI symptoms. The doctor asks appropriate follow-up questions, summarizes findings, and provides reasonable recommendations based on the patient's history and medication use. There are no unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments introduced, and the conversation remains focused on the light nature of the case.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and volunteers additional symptoms (dark stools, medication use) when prompted. For even greater realism, the patient could ask a clarifying question or express a concern about the symptoms or recommendations.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could clarify the plan for follow-up (e.g., whether labs or further evaluation will be needed) or explicitly mention reviewing the necessity of aspirin with the patient's primary provider.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate transitions between topics. The closing could be slightly more complete with a summary or explicit next steps.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The safety advice is appropriate for a mild case. The recommendation to discuss medication changes with the regular doctor is clear and safe. The only minor issue is that the conversation cuts off mid-sentence ('like alcohol or'), which should be completed for clarity.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in—how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I came in because I’ve been having nosebleeds, and then I ended up vomiting some blood. It’s made me pretty uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how often this has been happening—have you had just one episode of vomiting blood, or has it happened more than once? And with the nosebleeds, are they happening daily, or just occasionally?

**Patient**: I’ve had the vomiting blood just once so far. The nosebleeds have happened a couple of times, not every day. I’ve also noticed some pain in my stomach area.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the stomach pain—when did you first notice it, and does it come and go or is it constant?

**Patient**: I first noticed the stomach pain a couple of days ago. It’s not constant—it comes and goes throughout the day.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the nosebleeds—when did they first start, and do you notice anything that seems to trigger them, like blowing your nose or dry air?

**Patient**: They started a few days ago. I don’t think there’s anything specific that triggers them—they just seem to happen on their own.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you vomited blood, was it a small amount mixed with the vomit, or did it look like a larger amount? And did it appear bright red or dark, almost like coffee grounds? This helps me understand where the bleeding might be coming from.

**Patient**: It was a small amount mixed in with the vomit, and it looked more bright red than dark.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed feeling unusually tired, having black or tarry stools, or any changes in appetite recently?

**Patient**: I have noticed my stools have been darker, almost black. I haven’t felt more tired than usual, and my appetite hasn’t really changed.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you have a nosebleed, does it usually stop on its own, or do you need to do something specific to get it to stop? And about how long does each episode last?

**Patient**: They usually stop on their own after a few minutes. I don’t have to do anything special, just wait for it to stop.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about your overall health—do you take any medications, especially blood thinners or aspirin, or have any history of bleeding problems? This can sometimes affect how easily bleeding occurs.

**Patient**: Yes, I take aspirin, ibuprofen, and verapamil. I haven’t had any problems with bleeding before, even after surgeries or dental work.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you've had a few episodes of nosebleeds recently and one instance of vomiting a small amount of bright red blood, along with some stomach discomfort and darker stools. You also mentioned taking aspirin and ibuprofen, which can sometimes irritate the stomach lining and increase the risk of bleeding, especially when used together.

The combination of nosebleeds, vomiting blood, and dark stools suggests that there may be some irritation or mild bleeding in your upper digestive tract—possibly from your stomach or esophagus. Aspirin and ibuprofen are known to cause this kind of irritation, especially in older adults. The nosebleeds could be unrelated, but sometimes medications can make all types of bleeding more likely.

Right now, since your nosebleeds stop on their own and the vomiting blood was a one-time event with only a small amount, this seems to be a mild issue. However, the change in your stool color is important to monitor, as black stools can sometimes indicate bleeding higher up in the digestive tract.

Here’s what I recommend:
- Consider stopping ibuprofen for now, as both aspirin and ibuprofen together increase bleeding risk. You should discuss this with your regular doctor before making any changes.
- Watch for warning signs: If you have more vomiting of blood, large amounts of blood, persistent black stools, severe stomach pain, or feel faint or weak, seek medical attention promptly.
- Try to avoid things that might further irritate your stomach, like alcohol or

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining everything. I understand about the medications—I’ll talk to my regular doctor about stopping the ibuprofen. I’ll keep an eye out for any of those warning signs you mentioned.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 64-year-old female presenting with epistaxis followed by hematemesis. She reported left-sided nosebleed on the day of admission, swallowing blood, subsequent abdominal pain, and bloody hematemesis, as well as a history of frequent nosebleeds, recent coffee ground emesis, and seven to eight days of dark or tarry stools with crampy abdominal pain. Her past medical history includes hypertension and cholecystectomy, and she was taking verapamil, aspirin, ibuprofen, and unspecified Chinese herbs on admission; she has no known allergies. On evaluation, her hematocrit dropped from 37.5 to 29.5 but stabilized without need for transfusion; endoscopy revealed active bleeding in the posterior pharynx and mild gastritis, with no evidence of gastrointestinal ulceration or ongoing nasal bleeding. The documented diagnoses were epistaxis, posterior pharyngeal bleeding, mild gastritis, and anemia. Treatment included placement of Merocel in the left naris, discontinuation of aspirin and ibuprofen, initiation of Keflex 500 mg orally four times daily for five days, Protonix 40 mg daily for six weeks, and ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily for six months; verapamil was continued. She was discharged home with follow-up arranged with ENT and her primary care physician.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with recent episodes of nosebleeds and a single episode of hematemesis (vomiting a small amount of bright red blood). The nosebleeds began a few days ago, occur occasionally without clear triggers, and resolve spontaneously within minutes; the hematemesis was accompanied by intermittent stomach pain over the past couple of days and dark, almost black stools. The patient denies increased fatigue or appetite changes and reports taking aspirin, ibuprofen, and verapamil, with no prior history of bleeding problems. The clinical impression is mild upper gastrointestinal irritation or bleeding, likely related to concurrent use of aspirin and ibuprofen. The physician advised discontinuing ibuprofen (after consulting the patient’s regular doctor), monitoring for warning signs such as recurrent or large-volume hematemesis, persistent melena, severe abdominal pain, or symptoms of hemodynamic compromise. The patient was also counseled to avoid further gastric irritants and to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms worsen.
