## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile of exertional angina/NSTEMI and coronary artery disease. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the chest pain, its characteristics, associated symptoms, and triggers. The explanation and advice are reasonable for a light case, with clear safety instructions. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or major omissions. The conversation is coherent and role-appropriate.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce unsupported symptoms or history. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any medications or prior interventions if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For completeness, the doctor could briefly ask about current medications, recent hospitalizations, or clarify any history of similar episodes, but this is not strictly necessary for this light case.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between topics. The summary and safety advice at the end are appropriate.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The doctor gives clear instructions on when to seek urgent care and advises activity modification appropriately.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Good afternoon. What brings you in today, and how have you been feeling recently?

**Patient**: I've been having some chest pain when I exert myself, and it's making me a bit anxious. That's mainly why I came in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain itself—can you describe what it feels like when it comes on? For example, is it sharp, dull, pressure-like, or something else?

**Patient**: It feels more like a pressure in my chest, especially when I’m walking or going up stairs. It’s not really sharp, just uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: Okay. On a scale from 1 to 10, how intense would you say the pressure feels when it happens?

**Patient**: I’d rate it around a 6 when it’s at its worst. It usually eases up once I stop and rest for a bit.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the location—where in your chest do you feel this pressure? Is it more in the center, to one side, or somewhere else?

**Patient**: The pressure is mainly right in the center of my chest. I don’t notice it spreading to either side.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—when you feel this pressure, do you ever notice shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded?

**Patient**: I do notice it’s harder to breathe when the chest pressure comes on, especially if I’m walking uphill. I haven’t had any sweating or felt lightheaded, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. When did you first start noticing this chest pressure with exertion, and has it changed at all over time?

**Patient**: I first noticed the chest pressure a few weeks ago. It’s been about the same since then, not really getting worse or better.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if anything other than physical activity, like emotional stress or eating a large meal, can bring on this chest pressure?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed emotional stress or eating big meals bringing on the chest pressure. It mostly happens when I’m physically active.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about how quickly the chest pressure comes on when you start being active. Does it happen immediately, or does it build up after a few minutes?

**Patient**: It usually builds up after a few minutes of activity, not right away. If I keep going, the pressure gets stronger until I need to stop and rest.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your chest pressure that comes on gradually with physical activity and eases with rest sounds like it could be related to your heart not getting enough oxygen during exertion—a pattern we sometimes see with stable angina. This is often due to narrowed blood vessels supplying the heart.

It's a good sign that you don't have symptoms like lightheadedness or sweating, and that the discomfort doesn't come on suddenly or at rest. However, it's important to monitor for any changes, such as pain happening without activity, increasing intensity, or new symptoms like fainting or severe shortness of breath.

Right now, I recommend taking it easy with strenuous activity until we can check things further. Avoid pushing yourself if you feel the pressure coming on. If you notice the pain comes on at rest, lasts longer than usual, or is accompanied by other symptoms like nausea or severe breathlessness, seek medical attention promptly.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining that. I’ll make sure to take it easy and watch for any changes. It’s reassuring to know what might be causing it. If anything new comes up, I’ll let you know right away.

## EHR Summary

The patient is an 81-year-old male presenting with exertional angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He reported exertional chest pain and had elevated troponin levels on admission. His past medical history includes asthma, transient ischemic attack, hypercholesterolemia, ulcerative colitis, hypertension, osteoarthritis, GERD, and prior esophageal dilation and hiatal herniorrhaphy. Physical examination was notable for bilateral lower extremity varicosities (left greater than right) but was otherwise unremarkable; vital signs were stable. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe multivessel coronary artery disease with significant stenoses and an aneurysmal LAD. The documented diagnosis was NSTEMI with multivessel coronary artery disease. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG x3: LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to RCA) on hospital day 5. Treatment included preoperative dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel (Plavix) and surgical revascularization.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with chest pain during exertion, which has been causing anxiety. The chest pain was described as a pressure sensation, mainly in the center of the chest, rated at 6/10 intensity at its worst, and typically occurring after a few minutes of physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs; it eases with rest and does not radiate. The patient also reported mild shortness of breath accompanying the chest pressure during exertion but denied sweating, lightheadedness, or pain at rest. The symptoms have been present for a few weeks without significant change and are not triggered by emotional stress or eating large meals. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. The doctor assessed that the pattern of exertional chest pressure relieved by rest is suggestive of stable angina, likely due to reduced oxygen supply to the heart during activity. The doctor advised the patient to avoid strenuous activity, monitor for any changes in symptoms, and seek prompt medical attention if pain occurs at rest or is accompanied by new symptoms such as nausea or severe breathlessness. The patient expressed understanding of the assessment and recommendations.
