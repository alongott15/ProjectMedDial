## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the chest burning, explores relevant associated symptoms, and considers the patient's cardiac history. The patient provides clear, relevant answers. The doctor's explanation and recommendations are reasonable for a light case with known coronary artery disease and mild symptoms. The mention of sternal wound drainage is consistent with the profile, and the patient appropriately brings it up at the end. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or major omissions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant information and appropriately brings up a secondary concern (sternal drainage). For further realism, the patient could mention any self-management attempts or clarify if the drainage has changed.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and empathetic. For completeness, the doctor could acknowledge the sternal drainage when raised by the patient and ask clarifying questions about it (e.g., color, odor, amount), as this is relevant postoperatively.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between topics. The conversation could be slightly improved by integrating the sternal wound concern earlier or ensuring it is addressed before closing.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No major safety or clarity concerns. The doctor gives clear instructions about warning signs and activity modification. Addressing the sternal wound drainage directly would further enhance safety.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. Can you tell me more about what's been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been having this burning feeling in my chest every so often. It's made me a bit anxious.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first notice this burning sensation in your chest? Has it been happening for days, weeks, or longer?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been going on for at least a few days now. I also remember feeling some chest pain during my last exercise tolerance test.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what tends to bring on the burning sensation. Do you notice it more after eating, lying down, or with physical activity? Or does it seem to happen randomly?

**Patient**: It seems to happen more with physical activity, like during that exercise test. I don't really notice it after eating or lying down.

**Doctor**: Got it. When this burning sensation comes on during activity, does it stop if you rest, or does it linger for a while afterward?

**Patient**: Resting does help—it usually goes away after I stop what I'm doing. It doesn't tend to linger too long.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness along with the burning sensation during activity?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness with it. It's really just the burning in my chest.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the severity—when you feel this burning sensation, how strong is it on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most intense discomfort?

**Patient**: I'd rate it around a 5 or 6—it’s uncomfortable, but not unbearable. It definitely gets my attention though.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed if this burning feeling has changed at all over the past few days—either getting more frequent, lasting longer, or becoming more intense?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed it getting worse or happening more often. It seems about the same as when it started.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your medical history—do you have any known heart conditions or have you ever been told you have issues with your heart or blood vessels? This helps me understand if we need to consider anything beyond common causes for chest discomfort during activity.

**Patient**: Yes, I have coronary artery disease. That was diagnosed a while back.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like the burning sensation in your chest comes on with physical activity and goes away with rest, and you have a history of coronary artery disease. This pattern can sometimes suggest that your heart isn't getting enough oxygen during exertion, which is known as angina. It's good that you aren't experiencing other symptoms like shortness of breath or dizziness, and that the discomfort isn't getting worse.

Since you have a known heart condition, it's important to monitor these symptoms and avoid pushing yourself too hard during activity until we know more. If the discomfort becomes more intense, lasts longer, or starts happening at rest, those would be warning signs to seek medical attention promptly.

For now, I'd recommend keeping track of when these sensations occur, what you’re doing at the time, and how long they last. If anything changes or if you develop new symptoms, please let your healthcare team know right away. Would you like advice on safe levels of activity, or do you have questions about managing these episodes?

**Patient**: Thanks, that explanation helps put my mind at ease. I’d appreciate some advice on what kind of activity is safe for me right now. Also, I wanted to mention—I’ve noticed just a minimal amount of drainage from the lower part of my sternal incision. Should I be worried about that?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 75-year-old male presenting with chest pain described as occasional burning, unrelated to activity, occurring for a week and a half prior to admission. Symptoms were further evaluated with an exercise tolerance test, which revealed chest pain and ST segment depressions in V4 to V6 after four minutes of exercise. Relevant history includes coronary artery disease, migraines, and nephrolithiasis, with no known drug allergies. Cardiac catheterization showed significant coronary artery occlusions (90% LAD, 80% diagonal 1, 70% RCA), and a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) times three was performed. Postoperatively, the patient experienced minimal sternal drainage managed with Vancomycin, and no evidence of infection or hemodynamic instability was noted. The documented diagnoses were status post CABG x3, migraine headaches, possible history of transient ischemic attack, and nephrolithiasis. Discharge medications included Lopressor, Lasix, potassium chloride, aspirin, Lipitor, Plavix, Percocet, Colace, and Alphagan eyedrops. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up arranged with primary care and cardiology.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult with a history of coronary artery disease presenting with intermittent burning chest discomfort. The burning sensation has been present for at least a few days, occurs primarily with physical activity (such as during an exercise tolerance test), is rated 5–6/10 in severity, and resolves with rest; there are no associated symptoms such as dyspnea, sweating, or lightheadedness. The patient reports no worsening of symptoms over time. Relevant history includes a prior diagnosis of coronary artery disease and a mention of minimal drainage from the lower part of a sternal incision. The clinical impression documented by the physician is that the chest discomfort is likely angina, given the exertional pattern and cardiac history. The treatment plan includes monitoring symptoms, avoiding strenuous activity until further evaluation, and keeping a log of episodes with details about timing and triggers. The patient was advised to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms become more severe, last longer, or occur at rest. The patient also requested advice regarding safe levels of physical activity and mentioned minimal sternal incision drainage, but further assessment of the incision was not documented in this dialogue.
