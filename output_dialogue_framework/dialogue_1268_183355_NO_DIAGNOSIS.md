## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile (elderly male with CAD and exertional chest pressure). The doctor asks appropriate follow-up questions about the nature, timing, and associated symptoms of the chest pressure, and provides a plausible explanation and safe advice. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The conversation is clear, logical, and grounded in the provided context.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce unsupported symptoms or history. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any relevant medications or prior advice received, but this is not necessary.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly review the patient's known cardiac history (e.g., prior CABG or stent) to reinforce continuity of care, but the current approach is appropriate for a light case.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate transitions between symptom exploration, functional impact, and safety advice. The closing invitation for further questions is realistic.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The doctor appropriately advises on when to seek urgent care and encourages communication with the primary provider. The explanation of possible causes is clear and age-appropriate.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some pressure in my chest when I walk or do things around the house. It usually goes away when I sit down and rest.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your symptoms a bit more—when did you first notice this pressure, and has it changed over time?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it first started, but it's been going on for a little while now. The pressure seems about the same whenever I exert myself, and it goes away if I stop and rest.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—do you ever notice shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded when this pressure happens?

**Patient**: I haven't noticed any sweating or feeling lightheaded with it. I do have some chest congestion, though.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily routine—does this pressure ever come on when you're resting, or is it only with activity like walking or doing chores?

**Patient**: No, the pressure only comes on when I'm doing something active. If I'm just sitting or resting, I don't feel it.

**Doctor**: Alright. How would you describe the intensity of the pressure—would you say it's mild, moderate, or quite uncomfortable when it happens?

**Patient**: I'd call it moderate. It's uncomfortable enough that I have to stop what I'm doing, but it doesn't feel severe.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed if the pressure has been getting better, worse, or staying about the same over the past few weeks?

**Patient**: It's been staying about the same lately. I haven't noticed it getting any better or worse over the past few weeks.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your activities—does the pressure come on with certain types of movement, like climbing stairs or carrying groceries, or does it happen with any kind of exertion?

**Patient**: It usually happens when I'm climbing stairs or doing something like carrying groceries. Any kind of exertion seems to bring it on.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much is this affecting your ability to do your usual daily activities—are you finding that you need to limit what you do, or are you able to manage by taking breaks?

**Patient**: I have to take breaks more often now. I can still do most things, but I definitely need to slow down and rest when the pressure starts.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like the chest pressure comes on reliably with physical activity and eases up when you rest. This pattern often points to your heart not getting quite enough oxygen when it's working harder, which is a common issue as we get older. It's good that the discomfort isn't severe and that you haven't had symptoms like sweating or lightheadedness, but I do want to make sure we're keeping things safe.

Often, this type of exertional chest pressure can be related to narrowed blood vessels in the heart, but sometimes it can also be due to lung congestion or other causes. Since it's affecting your ability to do daily tasks and has been consistent for a while, I'd recommend letting your primary doctor know about these symptoms. They might want to check your heart with some simple tests and review your medications.

In the meantime, try to pace yourself and take breaks when you need to. If you ever notice the pressure coming on at rest, or if you develop new symptoms like severe shortness of breath, fainting, or discomfort that doesn't go away, those would be signs to seek medical attention promptly.

Would you like advice on ways to manage activity at home, or do you have any questions about what we've talked through?

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I’d appreciate any tips on managing my activities at home. I’ll make sure to let my primary doctor know about these symptoms too.

## EHR Summary

The patient is an 81-year-old male presenting with chest pressure on exertion that resolves with rest. He reported "chest congestion" and had a history of abnormal exercise treadmill test (ETT) and prior right coronary artery (RCA) stenting. His medical history includes hypertension, elevated lipids, coronary artery disease with RCA stent, bilateral carotid disease, and right lower extremity vein stripping; he has no known drug allergies. Cardiac catheterization revealed significant coronary artery disease: 70% left main, 80% left anterior descending, 50% circumflex, 90% obtuse marginal, and 50-60% RCA stenosis, with a patent RCA stent and ejection fraction of 61%. Physical exam was largely unremarkable except for bilateral below-knee varicosities and chronic venous stasis changes; laboratory results showed mild anemia and elevated creatinine. The documented diagnosis was severe multivessel coronary artery disease. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x3 (LIMA to LAD, free RIMA to OM, SVG to PDA) and was transferred postoperatively in stable condition. The treatment plan included postoperative monitoring and supportive care.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with chest pressure occurring during physical activity. The chest pressure is described as moderate in intensity, comes on reliably with exertion such as walking, climbing stairs, or carrying groceries, and resolves with rest; it has been present for a while without significant change and does not occur at rest. The patient denied associated symptoms of sweating or lightheadedness but reported some chest congestion. No specific medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. On assessment, the doctor noted that the exertional chest pressure pattern suggests the heart may not be getting enough oxygen during activity, possibly due to narrowed blood vessels or lung congestion. The doctor recommended informing the primary doctor about these symptoms for further evaluation, including possible heart tests and medication review. The patient was advised to pace activities, take breaks as needed, and seek prompt medical attention if symptoms occur at rest or if severe shortness of breath, fainting, or persistent discomfort develops. The patient expressed understanding and requested tips for managing activities at home.
