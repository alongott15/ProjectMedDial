## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly plausible for a primary care visit with a patient who has a history of coronary artery disease and CABG, presenting with recurrent, exertional angina symptoms. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the nature, triggers, and associated symptoms of the chest pain. The explanation of stable angina is accurate and well-communicated, and the advice to follow up with cardiology and monitor for worsening symptoms is appropriate. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The conversation is logical, clear, and consistent with the provided profile.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and describes symptoms well. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any current medications or prior advice received, but this is not required.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For completeness, the doctor could briefly confirm current medications or ask about medication adherence, but this is a minor point.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is natural and logical, with smooth transitions between topics and a clear summary at the end. The closing invitation for further questions is good practice.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The advice to seek prompt care for new or worsening symptoms is appropriate.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about any symptoms or concerns you've been having lately?

**Patient**: I've been having chest pain again, especially after I walk about a quarter of a mile. That's the main thing that's been bothering me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask—when you get this pain, does it go away if you stop and rest, or does it linger for a while?

**Patient**: If I stop and rest, the pain usually goes away after a few minutes. It doesn’t really linger once I’ve caught my

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—when this happens, do you ever notice shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any sweating or feeling lightheaded. It’s really just the chest pain that comes on when I exert myself.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much would you say this is impacting your usual activities or routines? Are you finding yourself avoiding certain things because of it?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve started to avoid longer walks because I don’t want the chest pain to come on. It’s made me a bit more cautious with my usual routines.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the quality of the discomfort—would you describe it as pressure, tightness, burning, or something else? And do you ever feel it anywhere besides your chest, like your arm, jaw, or back?

**Patient**: It feels more like a tightness or pressure in my chest. I don’t feel it anywhere else—just in the chest area.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this has changed over time—has the discomfort been getting more frequent or intense lately, or has it stayed about the same since you first noticed it?

**Patient**: It’s been about the same lately—not really getting worse, but not improving either. The chest tightness still happens every time I walk that distance.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you do get this tightness, how severe would you rate it on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine?

**Patient**: I’d rate the tightness around a 5 or 6 out of 10. It’s definitely uncomfortable, but not unbearable.

**Doctor**: I see. Has anything in particular seemed to trigger the discomfort more than just walking—like climbing stairs, cold weather, or eating a large meal? Or does it mostly come on with the same type of exertion each time?

**Patient**: Mostly, it comes on with the same type of exertion each time, like walking a certain distance. I haven’t noticed things like stairs, cold weather, or eating making it worse.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing a consistent tightness in your chest that comes on with a certain level of activity and goes away with rest. This pattern is often seen in a condition called stable angina, where the heart muscle temporarily doesn't get enough oxygen during exertion, leading to discomfort. It’s good that you’re not experiencing symptoms like sweating or lightheadedness, and that the pain isn’t worsening over time, but it’s still important to take these symptoms seriously.

What often happens in cases like this is that narrowing in the heart’s blood vessels can limit blood flow during physical activity, which brings on the tightness. The fact that it reliably improves with rest is reassuring, but since it's affecting your routines, I’d recommend following up with your cardiologist or primary care provider soon. They might want to review your current medications and possibly do some tests to make sure your heart is getting enough blood supply.

In the meantime, try to avoid activities that reliably bring on the discomfort, and watch for any new symptoms—such as pain at rest, pain that lasts longer than usual, or symptoms like shortness of breath or fainting. If any of those occur, seek medical attention promptly.

Let me know if you have any questions about what I’ve shared or if there’s anything else on your mind about these symptoms.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I understand why you want me to follow up, and I’ll make sure to do that. Is there anything I should change with my current medications until I see my cardiologist?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 61-year-old male presenting with recurrent exertional angina, characterized by chest pain after walking approximately one quarter of a mile, similar to symptoms experienced prior to his last cardiac intervention. Symptoms began about three weeks before admission and were triggered by exertion. His relevant history includes coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions, with no known drug allergies and ongoing medications including aspirin, Mevacor, atenolol, Imdur, Altace, and Plavix. The documented diagnosis was status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) times two. He underwent CABG with LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein graft to the PDA, and his postoperative course was uncomplicated except for a small amount of wound drainage, which resolved with brief vancomycin therapy. At discharge, he was in good condition and prescribed medications including Lopressor, Lasix, KCL, Colace, aspirin, Mevacor, Tylenol, Percocet, ibuprofen, Imdur, and Plavix. He was advised to follow up with his cardiologist in four weeks and his primary care physician in three to four weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with chest pain as the chief complaint. The chest pain is described as a tightness or pressure, rated 5–6 out of 10 in severity, and occurs consistently after walking about a quarter of a mile; it resolves within a few minutes of rest and does not radiate to other areas. The patient denies associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness, and reports that the discomfort has remained stable over time but has led to avoidance of longer walks. Relevant medical history, current medications, and allergies are not specified in the dialogue. The clinical impression documented by the doctor is stable angina, based on the exertional nature and relief with rest. The treatment plan includes advising the patient to avoid activities that reliably trigger symptoms, monitor for any new or worsening symptoms (such as pain at rest or associated shortness of breath), and to follow up soon with their cardiologist or primary care provider for further evaluation and possible medication review. No changes to current medications were recommended until after specialist follow-up. The patient was instructed to seek prompt medical attention if new concerning symptoms develop.
