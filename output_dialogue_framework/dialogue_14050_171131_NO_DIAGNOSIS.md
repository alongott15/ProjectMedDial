## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile and symptoms, focusing on upper GI bleeding, melena, hypotension, and relevant history. The doctor's questions and explanations are appropriate for a primary care or ED follow-up context in a light case. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The conversation is logical, with the patient providing plausible responses and the doctor offering clear, grounded explanations and safety advice.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and follows up with a reasonable question about other symptoms (leg swelling, weakness). For further realism, the patient could mention any recent changes in medications or clarify if the right-sided weakness is new or longstanding.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor does well to explain the likely source of bleeding and gives appropriate safety advice. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's history of heart failure and stroke when the patient asks about leg swelling and weakness, to show awareness of comorbidities.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, moving from symptom history to impact on daily life and safety advice. The only minor gap is that the conversation ends abruptly after the patient's last question; a brief closing statement from the doctor would improve completeness.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No major safety or clarity concerns. The doctor appropriately emphasizes warning signs and when to seek urgent care. A brief clarification about monitoring leg swelling or right-sided weakness (given the patient's CHF and CVA history) would enhance clarity.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s nice to see you today. What’s been bothering you lately or brought you in for a visit?

**Patient**: I came in because I’ve been throwing up blood, and that really scared me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what you noticed—was the blood bright red, dark, or did it look like coffee grounds? This can help us figure out where it might be coming from.

**Patient**: The blood looked pretty dark to me, not really bright red. I also noticed my stools have been black and kind of tarry.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when all of this began—how long ago did you first notice the vomiting and the change in your stools?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly, but I think the vomiting and black stools started a couple days ago.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how you’ve been feeling otherwise—have you noticed any lightheadedness, weakness, or feeling faint since this started?

**Patient**: I did have one episode where I felt pretty faint, and they told me my blood pressure was low in the emergency room. Otherwise, I’ve mostly just felt tired.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your appetite—have you been able to eat or drink anything since this started, or do you feel nauseated most of the time?

**Patient**: I've been able to eat and drink a little, but my appetite isn’t great. I haven’t felt really nauseated most of the time.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you had any pain or discomfort in your stomach area, or any recent use of medications like aspirin or ibuprofen? Sometimes these can play a role in symptoms like you’re describing.

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve had some discomfort in my right upper abdomen. I haven’t taken aspirin or ibuprofen recently—just my usual medications.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much would you say these symptoms are affecting your daily activities—are you able to get around the house and do your usual things, or have you needed more help than usual?

**Patient**: I’ve needed more help than usual, especially since I’ve been feeling weak and tired. It’s been harder to get around the house like I normally do.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, there are a few things that stand out. Vomiting dark blood and having black, tarry stools suggest that there may be some bleeding in your upper digestive tract, possibly the stomach or the first part of the small intestine. The discomfort in your right upper abdomen adds to this picture. When blood is exposed to stomach acid, it often turns dark and can make stools look black and sticky, which is what you're describing.

Feeling faint and weak, along with needing more help around the house, are signs that this bleeding may have affected your overall strength and possibly your blood pressure. This is why doctors take these symptoms seriously, especially in someone who is feeling more tired than usual.

While you haven’t had much nausea and can eat a little, the main concern is ongoing blood loss, which can make you feel weak or dizzy. Sometimes, medications like aspirin or ibuprofen can cause this, but since you haven’t taken them recently, we’d want to consider other causes such as ulcers or irritation in the stomach.

It’s important to keep an eye out for any worsening symptoms—like persistent vomiting, passing out, severe abdominal pain, or if you notice your stools staying very dark or you see more blood. These would need urgent attention.

For now, try to rest as much as possible, stay hydrated, and avoid any over-the-counter pain medications unless specifically told otherwise by your doctor. If you feel much weaker, dizzy when standing, or unable to keep any fluids down

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining that. I’ll make sure to watch out for those warning signs you mentioned. Is there anything I should do about the swelling in my legs or the weakness on my right side, or just focus on resting for now?

## EHR Summary

The patient is an 83-year-old female presenting with hematemesis and melanotic stools. She experienced two episodes of hematemesis and multiple episodes of melena, with one episode of hypotension in the Emergency Department. Her past medical history includes cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and a prior seizure disorder; she was treated for a congestive heart failure flare one month prior. On examination, she was hemodynamically stable after receiving fluids, with clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness, and mild bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results showed a hematocrit of 31.6 and an INR of 4.2. The clinical impression is gastrointestinal bleeding, likely upper GI source given hematemesis and bloody nasogastric lavage. Treatment included intravenous fluids, two units of fresh frozen plasma, and 5 mg subcutaneous Vitamin K. The patient was designated Do-Not-Resuscitate and Do-Not-Intubate, and did not report shortness of breath or chest pain.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with vomiting dark blood and black, tarry stools. Symptoms began a couple of days ago and included one episode of feeling faint (with low blood pressure noted in the emergency room), ongoing tiredness, decreased appetite (but able to eat and drink a little), right upper abdominal discomfort, and increased weakness requiring more help with daily activities. The patient denied recent use of aspirin or ibuprofen and reported taking only usual medications; no medication allergies were mentioned. On review, the doctor noted the presence of melena (black, tarry stools), hematemesis (vomiting dark blood), right upper abdominal discomfort, and generalized weakness. The doctor assessed that these findings suggest upper gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from the stomach or first part of the small intestine, and noted that ongoing blood loss may be contributing to weakness and low blood pressure. The doctor advised the patient to rest, stay hydrated, avoid over-the-counter pain medications unless directed otherwise, and monitor for worsening symptoms such as persistent vomiting, passing out, severe abdominal pain, or continued black stools. The patient was instructed to seek urgent care if these warning signs occur.
