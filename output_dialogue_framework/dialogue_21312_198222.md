## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: UNREALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.300
- **Justification**: The dialogue is thorough and clinically sound for a real upper GI bleed, but the case type is specified as 'light, common symptoms.' The patient profile includes severe findings (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, coffee ground emesis), but the instructions indicate this should be a mild case. The doctor appropriately recognizes the seriousness and recommends urgent care, but this is not consistent with the intended case type. There are no major hallucinations or unsupported facts, but the overall scenario is too severe for a 'light, common' case.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient's responses are clear and relevant, but the symptoms described (persistent melena, moderate pain, lightheadedness, coffee ground emesis, hypoxia) are too severe for a light/common case. For a mild scenario, the patient should report milder symptoms (e.g., mild abdominal discomfort, occasional dark stool without hemodynamic instability).

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates excellent clinical reasoning and communication, but the assessment and recommendations are for a severe case. For a light/common case, focus on reassurance, outpatient workup, or mild symptom management rather than urgent/emergent care.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and patient-centered, with appropriate follow-up questions and explanations. However, the escalation to emergency care is not appropriate for a 'light' case.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety issues in the context of the actual symptoms described. However, for research or simulation purposes, ensure that the severity of symptoms matches the intended case type to avoid confusion.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s nice to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what’s been going on and how it’s affecting your daily life?

**Patient**: I’ve been having these large black stools lately, and my stomach has been hurting quite a bit. It’s made it harder for me to get around and do my usual things at home.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your stomach discomfort—where exactly is the pain located, and does anything you do seem to make it better or worse?

**Patient**: The pain is mostly in my abdomen, but I’m not sure I can pinpoint exactly where. Lying down sometimes helps a little, but nothing really makes it go away.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your stools—when did you first notice they were black, and have you seen this every time you go to the bathroom, or just occasionally?

**Patient**: I first noticed the black stools a couple of days ago. It’s happened every time I’ve gone to the bathroom since then.

**Doctor**: Okay. How severe is the abdominal pain—would you describe it as mild, moderate, or severe? And have you noticed any lightheadedness or feeling faint when standing up?

**Patient**: The pain feels moderate to me, not the worst I’ve had but it’s uncomfortable. I have felt a bit lightheaded, especially when I stand up, and I know my blood pressure has been on the lower side.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you had any nausea, vomiting, or noticed if your appetite has changed recently?

**Patient**: I’ve had some vomiting, and the doctor mentioned it looked like coffee grounds. I haven’t really noticed much change in my appetite, and I haven’t had any nausea.

**Doctor**: Got it. With your blood pressure being on the lower side, have you noticed any increase in weakness or difficulty standing and walking around the house compared to your usual energy levels?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve definitely felt weaker and it’s harder to get up and move around the house than usual. Standing up makes me feel a bit unsteady.

**Doctor**: Alright. Let me ask—have you noticed any swelling in your legs, new shortness of breath, or chest discomfort along with these symptoms? Sometimes these can help us understand if anything else is contributing to your weakness.

**Patient**: I’ve been breathing faster than usual, and I need a few liters of oxygen to keep my levels up—my oxygen saturation has been around 90%. I haven’t noticed any new swelling in my legs or chest discomfort.

**Doctor**: I see. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine, how would you rate your abdominal pain right now?

**Patient**: Right now, I’d rate the abdominal pain at about a 6 out of 10. It’s bothersome but not unbearable.

**Doctor**: Let me share my thoughts about what you’ve described. The combination of black stools, vomiting material that looks like coffee grounds, abdominal discomfort, lower blood pressure, and feeling weaker all point toward the possibility of bleeding somewhere in your upper digestive tract—often the stomach or esophagus. Black stools and coffee ground-like vomit happen when blood is partially digested, which is why it looks that way.

This kind of bleeding can lead to lower blood pressure and lightheadedness because your body may not have enough circulating blood volume. The need for extra oxygen and your lower oxygen levels could also be related to feeling weak and tired.

Given these symptoms, this situation is more serious than a typical light or common problem. It’s important to get urgent medical attention, as ongoing bleeding can become dangerous. If you haven’t already, you should seek emergency care right away—treatment may involve fluids, blood tests, and possibly procedures to stop the bleeding.

While waiting for help, try not to stand up quickly, and avoid eating or drinking anything until you’re evaluated further. If you feel more unsteady, confused, or your breathing gets worse, call for emergency help immediately.

Would you like any more information about what might be causing this or what happens next?

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining all of that—it helps me understand what's going on. I do have a chronic ulcer on my right leg near my ankle, and sometimes I hear the nurses mention faint crackles in my lungs. Should I mention those to the team when they see me?
