## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the bleeding, associated symptoms, and possible causes, including medication use. The patient responses are coherent and match the symptoms listed in the profile. The doctor's reasoning about blood loss, ibuprofen risk, and recommendations for urgent evaluation are medically sound and appropriate for a light but concerning postoperative bleeding scenario. No unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments are introduced, and the conversation remains focused on the patient's actual symptoms and history.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could mention nausea earlier if it was present, as it is listed in the profile.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor could explicitly ask about all listed symptoms (including nausea) earlier in the conversation to ensure completeness. A brief check for other medications or comorbidities could further strengthen the assessment.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and builds appropriately from symptom onset to impact and risk factors. Consider summarizing key points before giving recommendations for added clarity.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate. The doctor correctly advises against further Advil use and recommends urgent evaluation without causing undue alarm. Clarity is high; however, reiterating what symptoms warrant immediate attention could be emphasized even more.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me what's been going on or if there's anything specific that's been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've noticed there's been more blood coming out through my nasogastric tube lately. That's what's got me a bit concerned.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the blood you've noticed—when did you first see this increase, and has it been steady or coming and going?

**Patient**: I first noticed the increase maybe a couple days ago, but I’m not exactly sure. It seems like it’s been pretty steady since then.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other changes you've noticed—have you had any sweating, lightheadedness, or changes in how you’re feeling overall since this started?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve definitely had some sweating and felt lightheaded since this started. Those symptoms seem to come and go throughout the day.

**Doctor**: Got it. Can you estimate how much blood you’re seeing—would you say it’s just streaks, or is it enough to change the color of what’s coming through the tube?

**Patient**: It's enough to change the color, not just streaks. The fluid coming through the tube looks noticeably more red than usual.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any black or tarry material in the tube output, or has it all looked red? This helps me understand where the bleeding might be coming from.

**Patient**: No, I haven't seen any black or tarry material. It's all looked red so far.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall energy—have you felt more tired or weak than usual since you noticed this change? Sometimes blood loss, even if gradual, can affect how you feel day to day.

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve felt more tired and weak than usual since this started. It’s definitely affected my energy day to day.

**Doctor**: Got it. Has anything in your routine—like changes in your tube care, medications, or what you’re eating or drinking—changed in the days before this started? Sometimes even small changes can affect bleeding risk.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t changed anything in my routine lately. I’m still taking Advil, and my tube care has been the same as usual. My eating and drinking habits haven’t changed either.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this is impacting your usual activities—are you able to move around and do daily tasks, or has the tiredness and weakness made that difficult?

**Patient**: It's definitely made things harder. I get tired pretty quickly and I've had to take breaks more often during my usual tasks.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like the increased blood in your tube and the symptoms of tiredness and lightheadedness could be related to ongoing blood loss. Even though you haven't changed your routine or medications recently, taking Advil (ibuprofen) can sometimes increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the stomach or upper digestive tract.

What often happens with this situation is that blood loss—even if it isn’t dramatic—can lead to feeling weaker and more fatigued, and the fact that the fluid is visibly red suggests active bleeding rather than something old or digested. Sweating and lightheadedness can also be signs that your body is reacting to this blood loss.

Given these findings, I do think it’s important to have this checked more urgently. Continued blood loss can become serious, especially if you’re feeling more tired and weak or having trouble with daily activities. I recommend contacting your healthcare team or going to an urgent care or emergency department to get evaluated further—they may want to check your blood count and see if any intervention is needed.

In the meantime, try to rest as much as possible and avoid any more Advil or similar medications until you’ve been evaluated. If you start to feel very dizzy, faint, have chest pain, or notice a large increase in bleeding, seek immediate medical attention.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I’ll make sure to stop the Advil and get checked out soon. I’ve also had some nausea along with everything else. Is that something I should mention when I go in?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 33-year-old male admitted for gastric bypass surgery due to morbid obesity. Postoperatively, he experienced increased blood from the nasogastric tube, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, and nausea without chest pain or dyspnea. His past medical history includes obesity, degenerative joint disease, heartburn, and headache; he has no known drug allergies and takes Advil at home. Physical examination was notable for stable vital signs and an obese, nontender abdomen; electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The clinical course was complicated by postoperative bleeding with a hematocrit drop to 18%, requiring transfusion of 6 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen platelets. The diagnosis was postoperative hemorrhage following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. After stabilization and cessation of bleeding, his hematocrit remained stable at 28%. At discharge, he was tolerating a stage three diet and prescribed Roxicet for pain, ranitidine, Actigall 300 mg twice daily for six months, and vitamin B supplementation.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with increased blood in their nasogastric tube output. They reported that the bleeding started a couple of days ago and has been steady, with the fluid appearing noticeably more red rather than just streaked. Associated symptoms included intermittent sweating, lightheadedness, increased tiredness, weakness, and difficulty performing daily activities; the patient also mentioned experiencing some nausea. There was no history of black or tarry material in the tube output, and no recent changes in tube care, medications (except ongoing Advil use), or diet were noted. On assessment, the doctor noted that the visible red blood and accompanying symptoms suggested ongoing active blood loss, possibly exacerbated by Advil (ibuprofen), which can increase bleeding risk. The doctor recommended urgent evaluation by the healthcare team or at an emergency department to check blood counts and determine if intervention is needed. The patient was advised to rest, avoid further Advil or similar medications, and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen.
