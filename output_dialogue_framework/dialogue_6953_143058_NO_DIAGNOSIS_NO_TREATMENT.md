## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the chest pain and related symptoms, explores the coffee ground emesis, and provides reasonable clinical reasoning for ruling out cardiac causes and highlighting concern for GI bleeding. The patient responses are coherent and match the documented symptoms. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could mention any history of alcohol use or withdrawal symptoms earlier, as these are part of the profile and could help guide the conversation.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor is thorough and empathetic. For improvement, the doctor could explicitly ask about alcohol use or withdrawal symptoms, given their relevance to both GI bleeding and anxiety/tremor in this profile.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, moving from symptom exploration to clinical reasoning and advice. To improve, the doctor could summarize next steps or clarify what immediate actions the patient should take.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate and clear. The doctor correctly advises against NSAIDs and highlights warning signs. For clarity, the doctor could briefly mention why alcohol withdrawal may be relevant to the current symptoms.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Good to see you today. What’s been bothering you lately, and how can I help?

**Patient**: I've been having some chest pain and I just feel really bad all over. It's got me pretty anxious, to be honest.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discomfort you’re feeling—when did you first notice the chest pain, and how long does it usually last when it comes on?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it started, but it's been coming and going for a few days now. The chest tightness usually lasts a few minutes each time.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the sensation—does the tightness ever spread to your arm, neck, or jaw, or is it always in the same spot?

**Patient**: No, the tightness stays in my chest. It doesn't spread to my arm, neck, or jaw.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about what you’re doing when the tightness comes on—does it happen at rest, with activity, or after eating?

**Patient**: It tends to come on when I'm just sitting around, not really doing anything physical. I haven't noticed it being related to eating or activity.

**Doctor**: Got it. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine, how would you rate the tightness when it happens?

**Patient**: I'd rate the tightness around a 6 out of 10 when it happens. It's uncomfortable, but not the worst pain I've felt.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any nausea, sweating, or trouble catching your breath when the tightness happens?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any sweating or shortness of breath with it. I do feel pretty anxious and kind of shaky when it happens, though.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the location—can you point to exactly where in your chest you feel the tightness? Is it more on the left, right, or in the center?

**Patient**: It's mostly right in the center of my chest, not really to one side or the other.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about the sensation—does it feel sharp, burning, pressure-like, or something else? And does anything you do seem to make it better or worse?

**Patient**: The sensation feels more like a pressure or tightness, not really sharp or burning. Nothing I do seems to make it better or worse. I've also had some coffee ground vomit and my hands have been pretty shaky.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, a few things stand out to me. The pressure in the center of your chest that comes on at rest and the fact that you haven’t noticed it with activity or eating makes some of the more urgent heart-related causes less likely, especially since you don’t have symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, or pain spreading to your arm or jaw. However, one thing that does concern me is the coffee ground appearance of your vomit. This can sometimes indicate bleeding in the upper part of your digestive tract, such as the stomach.

When someone has both chest discomfort and vomit that looks like coffee grounds, it’s important to rule out things like gastritis, ulcers, or other stomach issues that might be causing irritation or bleeding. The shakiness and anxiety could be your body’s response to feeling unwell or losing a small amount of blood.

Given these symptoms, I recommend you seek medical attention promptly—especially because of the vomiting with coffee ground appearance. While your chest discomfort doesn’t sound typical for a heart attack, bleeding in the digestive tract can be serious if left untreated. If you start to feel dizzy, weak, notice black stools, or the pain gets worse, those are warning signs to get care right away.

For now, avoid taking any medications like ibuprofen or aspirin, as they can worsen stomach irritation. Try to rest and keep track of any new symptoms. Would you like more information about what might cause this type of vomiting or what to expect

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I appreciate you being thorough—hearing that the chest pain doesn’t sound like a heart attack is a bit of a relief. I was worried about the vomiting, especially since it looked like coffee grounds. Can you tell me more about what kind of tests or treatments I might need if this is a gastrointestinal bleed?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 46-year-old man presenting with concerns about alcohol withdrawal ("detox") and a recent episode of chest pain. He reported binge drinking over several days, with his last drink on the morning of admission, and described feeling generally unwell and experiencing a transient chest tightness without associated diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, palpitations, or radiation; the chest pain resolved before arrival. Upon presentation, he began vomiting coffee ground emesis but denied prior gastrointestinal bleeding or other related symptoms. His past medical history includes alcohol abuse, HIV (non-progressor, never on antiretroviral therapy), hypertension, cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, anxiety disorder, macrocytic anemia, status post cholecystectomy, and depression. On exam, he was afebrile with blood pressure ranging from 120–170/90–100 mmHg and a pulse of 110–150 bpm; nasogastric lavage revealed persistent coffee ground emesis, and EKG showed no acute ischemic changes. The documented clinical impression included alcohol withdrawal and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment in the Emergency Department included aspirin, Lopressor, Protonix, Ativan, Valium, intravenous fluids, and Reglan.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with chest pain and a general feeling of malaise. Symptoms included intermittent central chest tightness rated 6/10 in severity, lasting a few minutes at a time, occurring at rest and not associated with activity or eating, described as pressure-like rather than sharp or burning, and not radiating to the arm, neck, or jaw. Additional symptoms included anxiety, shakiness, and an episode of coffee ground vomit; no sweating, shortness of breath, or nausea were reported. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. The doctor noted the absence of classic cardiac symptoms but expressed concern about the coffee ground appearance of the vomit, suggesting possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding such as gastritis or ulcers. The assessment was that urgent heart-related causes were less likely, but gastrointestinal bleeding needed prompt evaluation. The doctor recommended seeking medical attention promptly, especially due to the vomiting with coffee ground appearance, and advised avoiding NSAIDs like ibuprofen or aspirin, resting, and monitoring for worsening symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, black stools, or increased pain.
