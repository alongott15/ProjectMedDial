## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about gait changes, safety, and associated symptoms, and summarizes findings accurately. The advice is conservative and appropriate for a light case with the given history. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders are introduced. The patient responses are coherent and realistic.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses understanding. To enhance realism, the patient could occasionally express uncertainty or ask clarifying questions.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For further realism, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) in relation to gait changes, or mention possible follow-up if symptoms worsen.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and smooth, with clear transitions between topics. The conversation could be improved by including a closing summary or explicit plan for follow-up.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The doctor appropriately advises on red flag symptoms and fall prevention.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been a bit concerned lately because I was told I have a cerebral aneurysm. That's what brought me in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your walking—have you noticed any changes in your gait or balance recently, such as feeling unsteady or having difficulty walking?

**Patient**: Yes, I have noticed some changes in my gait. I've been feeling a bit unsteady and my walking seems off lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily routine—are these changes in your walking making it harder for you to do things like shopping, cooking, or getting around the house?

**Patient**: Yes, it's definitely made things like getting around the house and doing chores more challenging for me. I feel less steady on my feet, so I move slower and have to be more careful.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first start noticing these changes in your walking and feeling less steady?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it began, but I think it's been going on for at least a couple of weeks now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you had any episodes of dizziness, headaches, or vision changes along with feeling unsteady?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any dizziness, headaches, or changes in my vision. It's mostly just the changes in my gait and feeling unsteady.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if certain activities or times of day make your walking feel more unsteady, or is it fairly constant throughout the day?

**Patient**: It feels pretty constant throughout the day. I haven't noticed it getting better or worse with certain activities or times.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about your safety at home—have you had any falls or near-falls since these changes started?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any falls or near-falls since these changes started. I've been extra careful moving around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your muscle strength—do you feel any weakness in your legs or trouble lifting your feet when you walk?

**Patient**: I don't really feel weakness in my legs, but sometimes my left foot feels a bit swollen. I haven't had trouble lifting my feet when I walk.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your main concern is feeling unsteady while walking, which has been going on for a couple of weeks and affects your daily activities. You haven't had dizziness, headaches, or vision changes, and no falls, which is reassuring. 

Changes in gait can sometimes be related to nerve or muscle issues, or even changes in circulation, but with your history of a cerebral aneurysm, it's important to keep an eye on any new neurological symptoms. Since you mentioned some swelling in your left foot, that might also contribute to feeling unsteady.

At this point, I would recommend continuing to be cautious at home to prevent falls. If you notice any new symptoms—such as weakness, numbness, sudden severe headache, vision changes, or trouble speaking—those would be important to report right away. For now, gentle exercise and using support (like a cane or handrails) may help with stability.

Does anything seem to trigger your unsteadiness, or is it truly constant regardless of what you’re doing?

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining all of that. My unsteadiness really does seem constant, no matter what I'm doing. I appreciate your suggestions about being careful and using support around the house.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 65-year-old female presenting with a cerebral aneurysm. She reported no headache, vision problems, weakness, or paresthesias, but did note changes in her gait. Her past medical history includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; she is allergic to penicillin, Keflex, and Bactrim. On examination, she was frail but in no acute distress, with blood pressure 142/90, positive rales on chest exam, 1+ edema in the left foot, and an ataxic gait. The documented diagnosis was cerebral aneurysm. She underwent successful coiling of the aneurysm and remained neurologically stable postoperatively. Post-procedure care included hourly neurological checks and heparin to maintain PTT in the 50-60 range. She was discharged in stable condition with no new neurological deficits.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with concern about a known cerebral aneurysm and recent changes in gait. They reported feeling unsteady while walking for at least a couple of weeks, with the unsteadiness being constant throughout the day and making daily activities such as getting around the house and doing chores more challenging. The patient denied dizziness, headaches, vision changes, falls, or near-falls, and noted no leg weakness but did mention occasional swelling in the left foot. Relevant history includes a diagnosis of cerebral aneurysm; no medications or allergies were discussed. On assessment, the doctor noted the absence of acute neurological symptoms but highlighted the importance of monitoring for new symptoms given the aneurysm history. The doctor advised continued caution at home to prevent falls, recommended gentle exercise and use of support (such as a cane or handrails) for stability, and instructed the patient to report any new symptoms like weakness, numbness, sudden severe headache, vision changes, or trouble speaking immediately.
