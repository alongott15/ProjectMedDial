## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the onset, nature, and impact of hallucinations and behavioral changes, and explores possible triggers such as medication or illness. The patient responses align with the documented symptoms and diagnoses. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events introduced. The reasoning is clear and grounded in the context.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and describes symptoms in a way that matches the profile. For improvement, the patient could mention chronic back pain if prompted, as it is part of the profile.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could explicitly ask about chronic back pain or urinary symptoms, given the patient's history of arachnoiditis and UTI, to ensure a more comprehensive review.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate follow-up questions and explanations. To further improve, the doctor could summarize next steps or offer reassurance at the end.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns are present. The doctor appropriately avoids unsupported conclusions and explains reasoning clearly. For added clarity, a brief mention of monitoring or follow-up could be included.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in, and how have things been going for you recently?

**Patient**: I've been having some strange things happen—I started seeing things that aren't really there, and my behavior got a bit odd over the weekend. It's been pretty uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this has been affecting your usual routines—have these experiences made it hard to do things like work, socialize, or take care of yourself?

**Patient**: Yeah, it's definitely made things harder. I haven't really felt like myself, and it's been tough to keep up with my normal routines.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first notice these experiences starting, and have they been getting more frequent or intense since then?

**Patient**: I first noticed it over the weekend. It felt like things got a bit worse as the days went on.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the experiences you've had—when you see things that aren't really there, are they shapes, people, or something else? And do you notice if anything specific seems to trigger these episodes?

**Patient**: I've mostly seen shapes and things moving that aren't really there—no people, though. I haven't noticed anything specific that sets it off.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, sleep, or thinking along with these experiences? For example, feeling unusually energetic, sad, anxious, or having trouble concentrating?

**Patient**: I haven't really noticed big changes in my mood or sleep. My thinking has felt a little foggy, though, and I've been more tired than usual—kind of lethargic.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you mention your behavior got a bit odd, can you describe what felt different or unusual for you? For example, did you do things that surprised you, or did others notice changes?

**Patient**: My family mentioned I was acting strangely and saying odd things that didn't make sense. I also felt more out of it than usual, almost like I was in a fog.

**Doctor**: Got it. When these episodes happen, do you feel aware that things are unusual, or does it seem real at the time? Also, are you able to carry out your daily tasks during these moments, or do you need help from others?

**Patient**: During those moments, it feels real to me, and I don't always realize things are off until later. I do need help with daily tasks when it gets bad—my family has had to step in a few times.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about whether you've had any recent illnesses, changes in medications, or new substances—sometimes things like infections or medication side effects can trigger these kinds of symptoms.

**Patient**: I haven't had any recent illnesses or changes in my medications. I'm still on baclofen like usual and haven't started anything new.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, it sounds like you've experienced some visual disturbances and changes in your thinking and behavior over a short period, without recent illness or medication changes. Sometimes, symptoms like these can be related to medication side effects, metabolic imbalances, or even temporary confusion (what we call delirium), especially if there's an underlying trigger.

Let me share why I'm asking about your symptoms and history: understanding whether this is getting better or worse helps us figure out if it's a self-limited episode or something that needs more attention. Has there been any improvement since the weekend, or are you still experiencing these symptoms at the same level?

**Patient**: There's been a little improvement since the weekend, but I'm still not back to normal. I appreciate you explaining things—it helps to know what might be going on.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 49-year-old woman presenting with altered mental status, including episodes of hallucinations and bizarre behavior, following recent adjustments to her intrathecal baclofen pump. She initially became unresponsive after an overdose of intrathecal baclofen, which was subsequently corrected, but later developed psychosis and lethargy. Her past medical history includes chronic back pain, arachnoiditis from myelogram dye, and use of an intrathecal drug pump for pain management. On admission, she was awake, alert, and oriented, with stable vital signs and no focal neurological deficits; a head CT was negative. The clinical impression included baclofen overdose and subsequent withdrawal or medication adjustment effects, with secondary psychotic symptoms. Treatment involved supportive care, adjustment of the baclofen pump to 50% of its normal rate, initiation of Risperdal 0.25 mg orally twice daily for hallucinations, and antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and Macrodantin) for a urinary tract infection. She was evaluated by Physical and Occupational Therapy and deemed safe for discharge home with a cane. Follow-up with her physician was arranged in one week to reassess her intrathecal pump settings.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with new-onset visual hallucinations and behavioral changes as the chief complaint. Symptoms began over the weekend, with the patient seeing shapes and movement that are not present (no people), experiencing increased lethargy, and feeling mentally "foggy." The episodes have made it difficult for the patient to maintain normal routines and have required family assistance; the patient is sometimes unaware of the abnormality during episodes. There have been no recent illnesses, medication changes, or new substance use; the patient continues on baclofen as usual. The patient's mood and sleep have not changed significantly. The clinician notes possible causes such as medication side effects, metabolic imbalances, or delirium, but no definitive diagnosis is documented. The patient reports slight improvement since symptom onset. The treatment plan or specific recommendations are not documented in the dialogue.
