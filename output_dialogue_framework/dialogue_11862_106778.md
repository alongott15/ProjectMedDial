## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile and the case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the hematoma and cellulitis, assesses for signs of infection and systemic involvement, and provides reasonable home care advice with clear safety-netting instructions. The patient responses are plausible and align with the described symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or contradictions. The conversation is thorough but remains within the scope of a light, common case.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For added realism, the patient could mention any previous attempts at self-care or clarify if they have contacted their provider before.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's underlying conditions (e.g., CHF, atrial fibrillation) as risk factors for complications, or ask about anticoagulant use given the hematoma, but this is not strictly necessary for a light case.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, moving from symptom description to assessment and advice. Consider a brief summary or explicit check for understanding at the end, which was partially done.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety-netting is clear and appropriate. The advice is conservative and does not overstep the case type. No safety concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your leg—can you describe what the pain feels like at the site of the hematoma? For example, is it sharp, aching, or throbbing?

**Patient**: The pain is mostly at the spot where the hematoma is on my left leg. It feels more like an ache, but sometimes it gets a bit sharper if I try to move around. It’s pretty uncomfortable and makes it hard for me to get around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the hematoma—have you noticed any changes in its size, color, or if it's become more swollen recently?

**Patient**: I’ve noticed the area around the hematoma looks red and feels puffy, and it seems like there’s more swelling than before. I’m not sure about the size or color changing much, but the swelling stands out to me.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any warmth at the site of the swelling, or any drainage, like pus or fluid coming from the area?

**Patient**: Yes, the area does feel warmer than the rest of my leg. I haven’t noticed any drainage or fluid coming out, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. How long has this pain and swelling been going on, and has it changed in intensity since you first noticed it?

**Patient**: It’s been going on for several days now. The pain and swelling seem to have gotten a bit worse since I first noticed them. I’m having more trouble moving around because of it.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall health—have you had any fever, chills, or felt generally unwell since this started?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any fever or chills. I wouldn’t say I’ve felt generally unwell—just uncomfortable because of the pain and swelling in my leg.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your movement—are you able to walk or put weight on your leg, or does the discomfort make you avoid using it entirely?

**Patient**: It’s tough to walk or put weight on my left leg right now. The discomfort makes me avoid using it as much as possible.

**Doctor**: Alright. Does anything help relieve the discomfort or swelling—such as elevating your leg, applying ice, or resting? Or have you noticed anything that makes it worse?

**Patient**: Elevating my leg does seem to help with the swelling a bit. Resting helps with the pain, but moving around makes it worse. I haven’t tried ice yet.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the location—can you point to exactly where on your left leg the hematoma and pain are? For example, is it closer to your thigh, knee, calf, or ankle?

**Patient**: The hematoma and pain are on my left shin, just below the knee. That’s where most of the swelling and redness are.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your hematoma below the knee has become more swollen, red, and warm over several days, and it's making it difficult for you to walk or put weight on your leg. These changes can sometimes happen as a hematoma heals, but increased swelling, redness, and warmth may also suggest inflammation or possibly an infection developing in the area.

Since you haven't noticed any drainage or systemic symptoms like fever or chills, that's somewhat reassuring. However, worsening swelling and difficulty moving are signs we shouldn't ignore. Elevating your leg is a good step, and trying ice packs for short periods (about 15-20 minutes at a time) may help reduce swelling further.

If you notice new symptoms—like pus or fluid coming from the area, spreading redness, fever, or if the pain suddenly becomes much worse—it would be important to get checked promptly. For now, continue to rest and elevate your leg, and consider using ice. If things don't improve in the next day or two, or if you notice any of those warning signs, I recommend reaching out to your healthcare provider for a closer look.

Let me know if you have any questions about what we've discussed or about caring for your leg at home.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I’ll keep resting and keep my leg elevated, and I’ll try some ice packs like you mentioned. The pain and immobility have made it tough to get around, so I appreciate your advice. If anything changes or gets worse, I’ll reach out right away.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 69-year-old male presenting with left lower extremity cellulitis and hematoma following trauma to his left shin. He reported progressive swelling and pain at the hematoma site over six days, with surrounding erythema and edema but no fever, chills, weakness, or sensory deficits. His history is significant for congestive heart failure (EF 35%), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, prior aortic valve replacement, and multiple cardiac interventions; he is allergic to penicillin (rash) and morphine (paranoia). On admission, his INR was supratherapeutic at 4.4, and he had already completed four days of oral antibiotics without resolution of cellulitis. The documented diagnoses were left lower extremity hematoma, left leg cellulitis, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. Treatment included holding and then restarting Coumadin, IV Ancef followed by oral Keflex for a total of seven days, surgical evacuation of the hematoma, wound care with pressure dressings, and continuation of his cardiac medications. He was discharged home with plans for wound care follow-up and outpatient monitoring.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with pain and swelling at the site of a hematoma on the left shin, just below the knee. The pain is described as aching, occasionally sharper with movement, and has worsened over several days, making ambulation difficult. The area is noted to be red, puffy, and warmer than the surrounding skin, with increased swelling but no drainage, fever, or chills reported. Elevation helps reduce swelling, and resting alleviates pain, while movement exacerbates symptoms. The clinical impression is that the hematoma is showing signs of increased inflammation, with possible early infection considered due to worsening redness, warmth, and swelling. The treatment plan includes continued leg elevation, initiating ice packs for 15–20 minutes at a time, and monitoring for warning signs such as drainage, spreading redness, fever, or sudden worsening pain. The patient is advised to seek prompt medical attention if these symptoms develop or if there is no improvement within a couple of days.
