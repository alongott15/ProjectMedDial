## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly realistic for a primary-care setting evaluating a patient with known coronary artery disease presenting with new chest pain radiating to the neck and shoulder. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the onset, quality, associated symptoms, and history, and provides clear, evidence-based reasoning and recommendations. The patient responses are plausible and consistent with the profile. There are no hallucinations or unsupported content.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers. For even greater realism, the patient could occasionally express uncertainty or ask clarifying questions about medical terms.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and empathetic. For improvement, the doctor could briefly check for medication use (e.g., nitroglycerin) or allergies, which are common in this context, but this is a minor point.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between topics. The summary and recommendation are clear and well-timed.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety is well addressed; the doctor appropriately recommends prompt evaluation and gives clear instructions on warning signs. The explanation of angina is clear and accessible.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed this pain—did it come on suddenly, or has it been building up over time?

**Patient**: I think it came on more suddenly. I just noticed my chest started hurting, and then it spread to my neck and left shoulder.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the quality of the pain—would you describe it as sharp, pressure-like, burning, or something else?

**Patient**: It feels more like a pressure, not really sharp or burning. The pain spreads from my chest to my neck and left shoulder.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded along with this sensation?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded with this pain. It's mainly just the chest discomfort that goes to my neck and shoulder.

**Doctor**: Alright. How long does each episode last, and does anything in particular seem to bring it on or make it better?

**Patient**: Each episode lasts maybe a few minutes, though I’m not exactly sure. I haven’t noticed anything specific that brings it on, but resting does seem to help ease the discomfort.

**Doctor**: Got it. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine, how would you rate the discomfort during these episodes?

**Patient**: I’d rate it around a 6 out of 10 when it happens. It’s uncomfortable but not unbearable.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more thing—have you ever experienced anything like this before, or is this the first time you've had this kind of discomfort?

**Patient**: This kind of discomfort is new for me. I haven’t had chest pain like this before, especially with it spreading to my neck and shoulder.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your activity level—were you doing anything physical, like walking or climbing stairs, before the discomfort started? Or does it tend to happen even when you're at rest?

**Patient**: It tends to happen even when I’m at rest. I wasn’t doing anything physical before the discomfort started.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any history of heart or blood vessel problems—have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or any heart conditions in the past? This helps me understand if there are any risk factors that could be contributing.

**Patient**: I had a PTCA to the LAD back in 1996, and I had a positive ETT thallium for an inferior-posterior reversible defect a few months ago. I don’t recall being told I have high blood pressure or high cholesterol.

**Doctor**: Based on what you've told me, your symptoms—pressure-like discomfort in the chest that spreads to your neck and left shoulder, sometimes at rest, and a history of heart procedures—do raise some concern for possible heart-related causes. Even though you haven't noticed other symptoms like shortness of breath or sweating, the location and quality of your discomfort, plus your cardiac history, make it important not to ignore these episodes.

What often happens is that people with a history of coronary artery disease can experience angina, which is chest discomfort due to reduced blood flow to the heart. Sometimes, angina can feel like pressure and may radiate to the neck or shoulder, just as you've described. It can occur even at rest if the heart's blood supply is more limited.

Given your background and that this is a new symptom for you, I would recommend getting checked soon—ideally today—to rule out any ongoing heart issues. Even though the pain isn't severe and goes away with rest, it's best not to take chances with chest discomfort in someone with your history.

In the meantime, avoid strenuous activities and seek immediate attention if you develop symptoms like severe pain, difficulty breathing, nausea, or sweating. Would you like guidance on where to go for prompt evaluation?

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining all that. I understand why you’re concerned, and I appreciate your advice. Yes, I’d like to know where I should go to get checked out today.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 70-year-old female presenting with chest pain. She reported a 7/10 aching pain in the left chest radiating to the neck and left shoulder, which occurred at rest while going to bed, lasted through the night, and was not associated with nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, or diaphoresis; recent episodes were less responsive to rest and nitroglycerin. Her history includes diabetes mellitus (noninsulin-dependent), coronary artery disease with prior PTCA and stenting, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hiatal hernia; she has a questionable sulfa allergy. On admission, ECG showed normal sinus rhythm without acute changes, cardiac enzymes were not elevated, and cardiac catheterization revealed significant multi-vessel coronary artery disease. The documented diagnoses were two-vessel coronary artery disease (unstable angina), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was treated with nitroglycerin and heparin drips, aspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin, and insulin sliding scale; her antihypertensive regimen was adjusted to achieve better blood pressure control. She was transferred in stable condition to Cardiothoracic Surgery for planned coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with sudden-onset chest pain as the chief complaint. The discomfort is described as pressure-like, rated 6 out of 10 in severity, radiating from the chest to the neck and left shoulder, lasting a few minutes per episode, occurring even at rest, and relieved by rest; there are no associated symptoms such as dyspnea, diaphoresis, or lightheadedness. This is a new symptom for the patient, who has a history of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) in 1996 and a recent positive exercise tolerance test (ETT) thallium scan indicating an inferior-posterior reversible defect; there is no known history of hypertension or hyperlipidemia. The clinical impression documented is possible angina due to coronary artery disease. The physician recommended prompt evaluation today to rule out ongoing cardiac issues, advised avoiding strenuous activity, and instructed the patient to seek immediate care if severe symptoms develop. Guidance on where to seek prompt evaluation was offered.
