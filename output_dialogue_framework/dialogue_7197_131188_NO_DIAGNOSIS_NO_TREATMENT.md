## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the chest pressure, associated symptoms, and functional limitations, and the patient responds with relevant details that match the profile (e.g., exertional chest pain, shortness of breath, claudication). The doctor's reasoning and explanation are clear, and the recommendations are appropriate for a light case with known coronary artery disease. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For even greater realism, occasional uncertainty or elaboration (e.g., describing anxiety or how symptoms affect daily life) could be added.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's questioning and explanations are thorough and empathetic. To further improve realism, the doctor could briefly review current medications or ask about diabetes/hypertension control, given the patient's history.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and smooth, with each turn building on the previous one. The summary and plan are well-articulated. A closing question about other concerns or a brief check for understanding could enhance completeness.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The advice to seek prompt evaluation and warning signs for urgent care are appropriate for the scenario.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me what’s been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been having this chest pressure lately, and it's made me pretty anxious. That's the main thing that's been bothering me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you tend to notice this chest pressure—does it usually come on when you're at rest, or does it happen more with physical activity?

**Patient**: It tends to get worse when I'm moving around, especially if I'm walking or doing something active. Resting does seem to help a bit.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any shortness of breath when this pressure comes on, or does it ever spread to your arm or jaw?

**Patient**: Yes, I do get shortness of breath when the chest pressure comes on. Sometimes the pain spreads down my left arm, too.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long these episodes usually last—are we talking minutes, or does it go on for longer? And does the discomfort completely go away when you rest?

**Patient**: Most of the time, the episodes last just a few minutes. Resting usually makes the discomfort go away, but sometimes it takes a little while before I feel back to normal.

**Doctor**: Okay. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most intense discomfort you can imagine, how would you rate the pressure when it comes on?

**Patient**: I'd rate the pressure around a 6 or 7 when it comes on. It's uncomfortable, but not the worst pain I've ever had.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about when this first began—has this been going on for days, weeks, or longer? And have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?

**Patient**: This has been going on for a while, probably weeks. I haven’t noticed any swelling in my legs or feet, but I do get claudication after walking about a block. My breathing also feels a bit poor sometimes.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discomfort in your arm—does it feel like a sharp pain, or is it more of a dull ache or numbness? And does that sensation ever linger after the chest pressure goes away?

**Patient**: It's more of a dull ache that goes down my left arm. The sensation usually fades when the chest pressure goes away; it doesn't tend to linger.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you mention claudication after walking about a block, is that discomfort mostly in your legs, and does it improve when you stop and rest?

**Patient**: Yes, the discomfort is mostly in my legs. It does get better when I stop and rest for a bit.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms—pressure in your chest that gets worse with activity, shortness of breath, discomfort in your arm, and leg discomfort after walking—suggest that your heart and circulation may be involved. When symptoms like these come on with exertion and improve with rest, it can sometimes point to issues with blood flow to the heart or legs, such as angina or peripheral artery disease. The fact that the discomfort resolves with rest and doesn’t linger is also an important detail.

What often happens in these situations is that the heart or leg muscles aren't getting enough oxygen-rich blood during activity, which can cause the symptoms you’ve described. While these types of symptoms can sometimes be caused by less serious conditions, they can also be a warning sign of something that needs prompt attention.

Given the pattern and duration you’ve mentioned, I recommend that you get evaluated soon—ideally within the next day or two—to have your heart and circulation checked more thoroughly. If you notice any new symptoms like severe chest pain at rest, fainting, sweating, or nausea, those would be reasons to seek immediate care.

In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity and take it easy until you’ve been seen. Does that plan make sense to you, or is there anything else you’d like to discuss about your symptoms?

**Patient**: Thanks, that plan does make sense to me. I appreciate you explaining it clearly. I’ll make sure to take it easy and get checked soon. If anything changes, I’ll let you know.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 40-year-old woman presenting with chest pressure occurring daily for one week, primarily on exertion and associated with shortness of breath and occasional radiation to the left arm. Symptoms escalated to include chest pain at rest the evening before admission, which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin. She has a history of longstanding diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, three-vessel coronary artery disease, and prior myocardial infarction managed medically. Cardiac catheterization revealed significant multi-vessel coronary artery disease (50% left main, 80% LAD, 80–90% left circumflex, 90% left RCA) with an ejection fraction of 50%. The documented diagnosis was severe three-vessel coronary artery disease. She underwent successful coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG x3) and had an uncomplicated postoperative course aside from transient poor respiratory effort requiring intensive care monitoring. At discharge, she was stable and prescribed aspirin, Prilosec, Lasix, potassium chloride, metoprolol, Lipitor, Percocet as needed, and insulin. She was advised to follow up in the wound clinic in two weeks and with her cardiologist and primary care provider in four weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with chest pressure as the chief complaint. The chest pressure is rated 6–7/10 in intensity, worsens with physical activity, and improves with rest; episodes last a few minutes and are accompanied by shortness of breath and a dull ache radiating down the left arm, which also resolves with rest. The patient reports these symptoms have been ongoing for weeks and also describes claudication in the legs after walking about a block, which improves with rest; no leg swelling is noted. Relevant history, medications, and allergies are not specified in the dialogue. The clinical impression documented by the doctor is possible angina and peripheral artery disease, given exertional symptoms and improvement with rest. The treatment plan includes prompt evaluation of heart and circulation within the next day or two, instructions to avoid strenuous activity, and advice to seek immediate care if severe symptoms develop.
