## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly plausible for a light, common cardiac case in a preoperative patient with atrial fibrillation and scheduled CABG. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the arrhythmia, symptoms, triggers, and duration, and provides clear, cautious advice without introducing unsupported diagnoses or treatments. The patient responds realistically, expresses concern, and seeks clarification. There are no hallucinations or contradictions with the provided profile.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could mention any medications currently being taken or clarify if they've already informed their cardiologist, but this is minor.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor is thorough and empathetic. For improvement, could briefly clarify what details (e.g., time of onset, associated symptoms) are most useful to record for the cardiologist when the patient asks about tracking episodes.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good back-and-forth and escalation of detail. The closing is supportive and encourages patient engagement.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. Advice is appropriately cautious given the upcoming surgery and cardiac history. Clarity is excellent throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I’m here because I’ve been dealing with some rapid heartbeats lately. It’s got me a bit concerned, especially since I’m scheduled for an elective CABG soon.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first notice these rapid heartbeats, and how often are you experiencing them?

**Patient**: I first noticed the rapid heartbeats a few days ago. They seem to come and go, not all the time, but enough that I’m aware of them.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more question—when these episodes happen, do you feel lightheaded, short of breath, or notice any chest discomfort?

**Patient**: I haven’t really felt lightheaded or short of breath. Sometimes there’s a little chest discomfort, but it’s not severe.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if anything seems to trigger these episodes, like activity, stress, or certain times of day? Or do they seem to happen randomly?

**Patient**: They seem to happen randomly. I haven’t noticed any specific triggers like activity or stress setting them off.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the duration—when these episodes happen, how long do they usually last? Are we talking seconds, minutes, or longer?

**Patient**: They usually last a few minutes at a time. I haven’t timed them exactly, but it’s definitely more than just a few seconds.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall well-being—after these episodes pass, do you feel back to normal, or do you notice any lingering fatigue or weakness?

**Patient**: I feel back to normal once the episode passes. I haven’t noticed any lasting fatigue or weakness afterward.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more thing—have you ever had anything like this happen before, or is this the first time you’ve experienced rapid heartbeats like this?

**Patient**: This is the first time I’ve experienced rapid heartbeats like this. It hasn’t happened to me before.

**Doctor**: I see. Since these episodes have been happening over the past few days, would you say they’re getting more frequent or intense, staying about the same, or have they started to improve?

**Patient**: They’ve been staying about the same—no real change in how often or how strong the episodes are.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, it sounds like you’re experiencing brief episodes of a rapid heartbeat that come and go over several minutes, without significant symptoms afterward and no clear triggers. Since you’re scheduled for an elective CABG, it’s understandable to be concerned—heart rhythm changes can sometimes happen in people with underlying heart conditions.

Most episodes like this are benign, especially if you’re not having severe chest pain, fainting, or ongoing shortness of breath. However, because you’re awaiting heart surgery, it’s important to mention these symptoms to your cardiologist or surgical team. They may want to check your heart rhythm with an ECG or monitor to rule out any arrhythmias that could affect your procedure.

For now, try to note when these episodes happen and if anything seems to bring them on. If you develop new symptoms like severe chest pain, fainting, or significant shortness of breath, seek medical attention right away.

Let me know if you have any questions about what this could mean or how to monitor your symptoms before your surgery.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I’ll make sure to keep track of when the episodes happen and mention it to my cardiologist. I appreciate you letting me know what to watch for—if anything changes, I’ll reach out right away.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, these brief episodes of a rapid heartbeat that come and go without severe symptoms are often due to common rhythm disturbances, especially in people with heart conditions. Since you’re scheduled for heart surgery, it’s important to be cautious and make sure your care team is aware.

What often happens in cases like this is that the heart's electrical system can become a bit more sensitive, sometimes causing extra beats or short runs of rapid rhythm. Most of the time, if there’s no ongoing chest pain, fainting, or major shortness of breath, these are not immediately dangerous, but they do need to be evaluated—especially before surgery.

My recommendation is to keep tracking when these episodes occur and whether any new symptoms develop. Let your cardiologist know about these episodes as soon as possible; they may want to do an ECG or a monitor to check your rhythm before your procedure. If you notice anything new or worrisome—like fainting, severe pain, or trouble breathing—seek help right away.

Let me know if you have any questions about what to expect or how to monitor your symptoms going forward.

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I’ll keep track of when these episodes happen and let my cardiologist know. Is there anything specific I should write down about the episodes that would be most helpful for them?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted for an elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) times two. He had no acute symptoms on admission and was in no distress, with normal cardiac and pulmonary findings. His past medical history includes hypercholesterolemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatic fever, renal stones, hiatal hernia, and rheumatoid arthritis; he takes Toprol, Plaquenil, Terazosin, iron, aspirin, simvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide, with no known drug allergies. During his hospital course, he underwent CABG with saphenous vein grafts to OM-I and PDA, and postoperatively developed rapid atrial fibrillation on day three, which was treated successfully with Lopressor and Amiodarone. The documented diagnosis was postoperative atrial fibrillation following CABG. He was discharged in good condition on a regimen including Lopressor, Amiodarone (taper), simvastatin, Percocet as needed, aspirin, potassium supplement, Lasix, and Colace. Follow-up with his physician was advised in four weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is presenting with episodes of rapid heartbeat (palpitations) as the chief complaint. These episodes began a few days ago, occur intermittently without clear triggers, last several minutes, and are not associated with lightheadedness, dyspnea, or significant chest discomfort; the patient returns to baseline after each episode and reports no lingering symptoms. There is no prior history of similar symptoms, and the patient is scheduled for an elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The clinical impression is that these are brief episodes of rapid heart rhythm, likely benign but potentially related to underlying heart disease. No acute arrhythmia or dangerous symptoms were identified during the visit. The treatment plan includes monitoring and documenting the timing and characteristics of episodes, informing the cardiologist or surgical team prior to surgery, and seeking immediate care if severe chest pain, syncope, or significant shortness of breath develops. The doctor also recommended possible ECG or rhythm monitoring before the procedure. No new medications or interventions were initiated at this visit.
