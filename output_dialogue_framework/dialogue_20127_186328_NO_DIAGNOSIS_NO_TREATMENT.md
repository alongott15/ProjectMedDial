## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—have you noticed any changes or concerns lately that you'd like to talk about?

**Patient**: I guess my main concern is that they couldn’t finish my colonoscopy because of a large growth, and now I’m scheduled for surgery. I wanted to talk about that and see what to expect.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how you’ve been feeling otherwise—have you noticed any new issues like mild confusion or feeling more agitated than usual since all this started? Sometimes stress or changes in health can affect how we think and feel, so it’s helpful to know.

**Patient**: Yes, I have noticed some mild confusion and feeling a bit more agitated than usual. It’s been happening off and on since all this started, but I’m not sure exactly when it began.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your heart—have you noticed your heart beating faster than usual or any fluttering sensations, especially when you feel more agitated? Sometimes stress and medical concerns can affect your heart rate, and it’s helpful to know if that’s happening.

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve definitely felt my heart beating faster, especially when I’m more agitated. It seems to pick up during those times, but I haven’t noticed any fluttering sensations.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your sleep—has this stress or the recent changes affected how well you’re sleeping at night? Sometimes poor sleep can make confusion and agitation more noticeable.

**Patient**: I’ve had a tougher time sleeping lately, probably because of all the stress and changes. I think that’s made the confusion and agitation a bit worse some days.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any fever or chills recently? Sometimes infections or inflammation can cause these symptoms, especially if there are changes in your body like a new growth.

**Patient**: I’ve had some fever along with the fast heart rate. I don’t remember having chills, but the fever did come and go for a bit.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the fever—do you recall when it first started and how high your temperature got? Knowing the timing and severity can help figure out if this is related to the growth or possibly something else.

**Patient**: I don’t remember exactly when the fever started, but it was sometime after all this began. I’m not sure how high my temperature got—I didn’t check it myself.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your heart rate—do you notice it speeding up mostly when you’re feeling stressed, or does it also happen when you’re resting or asleep? This can help us understand if it’s mainly related to anxiety or if there might be another cause.

**Patient**: The faster heart rate seems to happen mostly when I’m stressed or agitated. I haven’t really noticed it speeding up while I’m resting or asleep.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much are these symptoms—like the confusion, agitation, and trouble sleeping—affecting your ability to do your usual daily activities, such as managing meals, taking medications, or getting around the house? This helps me understand how much support you might need right now.

**Patient**: I’ve had some trouble keeping up with my usual routine, especially when I was more confused and agitated. Managing my medications was harder for a while, but my mental status became clear around nine days after surgery. It’s gotten better since then.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, it sounds like the stress of dealing with your recent diagnosis and surgery, along with the uncertainty around next steps, has affected your mood, sleep, and at times your ability to manage daily tasks. It’s common for people in your situation to experience some confusion and agitation, especially after a stressful medical event and changes in routine. The fact that your mental clarity improved about nine days after surgery is reassuring—it suggests that these symptoms may have been related to the stress of the procedure, anesthesia, or even the hospital environment.

The episodes of faster heart rate mostly when you’re agitated also fit with a stress response, rather than a persistent heart or infection problem. The fever you experienced is worth monitoring, but since it’s not ongoing and you’re feeling clearer now, it’s less likely to be an active infection. Still, if fever returns or worsens, or if confusion comes back suddenly, those would be important to report quickly.

What often happens in situations like this is that as your body and mind recover from the stress of surgery and adjustment to new routines, symptoms like confusion and trouble sleeping gradually improve. Keeping a consistent sleep schedule, staying hydrated, and asking for help with medications or daily tasks as needed can all support your recovery.

If you notice any return of confusion, new fevers, difficulty breathing, chest pain, or if you’re unable to manage at home, those are signs to seek prompt medical attention. Otherwise, focusing on rest and gradual return to

**Patient**: That all makes sense. I do feel relieved knowing these symptoms are common after surgery and that things have been improving. If anything changes, I’ll make sure to let you know right away.

**Doctor**: Let me share my thoughts on what you’ve described. It sounds like your symptoms—such as changes in mood, sleep, and some confusion—began around the time of your surgery and have gradually improved as you recovered. This pattern is actually quite common after a stressful medical event, especially one involving anesthesia and changes in your daily routine. The brief episodes of increased heart rate when you feel agitated also fit with what we often see as part of the body’s normal response to stress.

The improvement in your mental clarity over time is a very reassuring sign. It suggests that these symptoms were likely temporary and related to the acute stress and recovery period, rather than an ongoing problem. Your experience with fever is something to keep in mind, but since it hasn’t persisted and you’re feeling clearer now, it doesn’t point to a current infection.

As you continue recovering, it’s important to focus on good sleep habits, keeping a regular routine, and accepting help when you need it. If you notice any new or worsening symptoms—like persistent fever, sudden confusion, or difficulty managing at home—those would be reasons to reach out quickly.

If you have any questions about what to expect next or how to support your recovery, I’m here to help walk you through it.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining everything so clearly. I feel better knowing these symptoms are likely just part of the recovery process. If anything new comes up, I’ll reach out right away. Is there anything specific I should watch for as I get back to my routine?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted for surgical management of a large adenoma at the hepatic flexure after an incomplete colonoscopy. He underwent an extended right colectomy, initially laparoscopic but converted to open, and initially did well postoperatively with morphine PCA for pain control. On postoperative day two, he developed agitation and confusion, progressing to florid delirium tremens with tachycardia and ST depressions, attributed to alcohol withdrawal. His hospital course was further complicated by aspiration pneumonia with E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus identified in sputum cultures. Past medical history includes diabetes mellitus, prior prostatectomy, artificial urinary sphincter, agoraphobia, osteoarthritis, and alcohol use; home medication was Celexa, and he has a sulfa allergy. The documented diagnoses were alcohol withdrawal with delirium tremens and aspiration pneumonia. Treatment included Ativan drip transitioned to Valium, Lopressor for heart rate control, thiamine, folate, multivitamin supplementation, and Levofloxacin for pneumonia. At discharge, he was stable, tolerating a soft diet, and sent home with a 10-day course of Levofloxacin and instructions to follow up in 2–3 weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with concerns following an incomplete colonoscopy due to a large growth and is now scheduled for surgery. Key symptoms included intermittent mild confusion, agitation, difficulty sleeping, and episodes of increased heart rate primarily during periods of stress or agitation; the patient also reported transient fever without chills, with unclear onset and no measured temperature. These symptoms began around the time of surgery and initially affected the patient's ability to manage daily activities and medications, but mental clarity improved approximately nine days postoperatively. Relevant history includes recent surgery for a large growth found during colonoscopy; no specific chronic medical conditions, medications, or allergies were documented. The clinical impression was that the confusion, agitation, sleep disturbance, and episodic tachycardia were likely related to perioperative stress, anesthesia effects, and changes in routine, rather than ongoing infection or cardiac pathology. The fever was noted but not persistent, and no current signs of active infection were present. The treatment plan emphasized supportive care: maintaining good sleep hygiene, hydration, a regular routine, and seeking assistance with daily tasks as needed. The patient was advised to monitor for recurrence or worsening of confusion, persistent fever, new symptoms such as chest pain or dyspnea, or inability to manage at home, and to seek prompt medical attention if these occur.
