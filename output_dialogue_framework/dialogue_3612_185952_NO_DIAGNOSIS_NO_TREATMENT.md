## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks relevant, logical questions about the onset, progression, and associated symptoms of tongue swelling, including neck sensation, speech changes, swallowing, triggers, and breathing. The patient responses are plausible and match the documented symptoms. The doctor's reasoning and advice are appropriate for a mild case with airway symptoms but no acute deterioration. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe interventions are introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could specify the exact duration of symptoms if possible, and mention any history of similar episodes.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's questioning and explanations are thorough and empathetic. For improvement, the doctor could clarify whether the patient has any history of angioedema or allergies, and briefly review current medications for known triggers.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between symptom exploration and safety advice. To enhance realism, a brief summary or plan (e.g., monitoring instructions or follow-up) could be added at the end.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate for a mild case but could be strengthened by explicitly advising when to seek urgent care (e.g., if breathing worsens or swallowing becomes difficult). Clarity is good throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What has been bothering you the most lately?

**Patient**: My tongue has been swelling up, and it's really been bothering me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the swelling—when did you first notice your tongue feeling this way?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly, but I think I first noticed the swelling a couple of days ago.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other sensations—have you noticed any changes in your neck, such as tightness or discomfort, along with the swelling?

**Patient**: Yes, I've had a strange feeling in my neck along with the swollen tongue. It’s not painful, but it does feel a bit unusual.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your speech—have you noticed any changes, like difficulty speaking clearly or slurring your words, since the swelling began?

**Patient**: Yes, I have noticed some slurred speech since my tongue started swelling. It’s a bit harder to speak clearly than usual.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has the swelling and unusual sensation in your neck been getting better, worse, or staying about the same since you first noticed it?

**Patient**: The swelling and that odd feeling in my neck have pretty much stayed the same since I first noticed them. They haven’t really gotten better or worse.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask—have you had any difficulty swallowing or changes in your ability to eat or drink since this started?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any trouble swallowing or changes with eating or drinking since this started.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about possible triggers—have you recently started any new foods, medications, or dental products before this swelling began? Sometimes changes like these can lead to reactions in the mouth.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t started any new foods or dental products. As for medications, I’ve been taking the same ones for a while now.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since your speech has been affected, have you noticed any changes in your breathing, such as feeling short of breath or noisy breathing, at any point since the swelling began?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve had some wheezing since the swelling started. My breathing hasn’t felt quite normal.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your tongue swelling, changes in speech, and new onset of wheezing are important symptoms to pay attention to. Swelling in the mouth and throat area can sometimes be caused by allergic reactions, medication side effects, or local irritation, but you haven’t started anything new recently. The fact that your breathing feels abnormal and you’re experiencing wheezing makes this more concerning, as these can be signs that the airway is being affected.

While your symptoms have stayed stable and you haven’t had trouble swallowing, any combination of tongue swelling and breathing changes should be monitored closely. If at any point you notice the swelling getting worse, increased difficulty breathing, or trouble swallowing, it’s important to seek medical attention promptly.

For now, I recommend avoiding any potential irritants—such as spicy foods or mouthwashes—and keeping track of any changes in your symptoms. If you notice any triggers that seem to make the swelling or breathing worse, let me know. Would you say anything in particular seems to bring on the strange feeling in your neck or the wheezing?

**Patient**: Nothing in particular seems to bring on the strange feeling in my neck or the wheezing. It just sort of happens along with the tongue swelling and slurred speech. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly—it helps me feel a bit more at ease.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 79-year-old female presenting with a chief complaint of tongue swelling that began earlier in the evening. She reported waking up with a strange sensation in her neck and a swollen tongue, but denied chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, rash, or itching. Her medical history includes atrial fibrillation, hypertension, questionable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypercholesterolemia, depression, osteoarthritis (status post bilateral total knee replacement), and spinal stenosis; she is allergic to Bactrim and has been taking lisinopril since August of the previous year. She recently completed a course of Ceftin following a COPD flare. In the Emergency Department, she was treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 150 mg and an H2 blocker, and was evaluated by Anesthesia. She was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation. The clinical impression suggests angioedema, likely related to ACE inhibitor use (lisinopril), though this is not explicitly stated in the note. The treatment plan included continued observation and supportive care.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with tongue swelling as the chief complaint. Symptoms included tongue swelling noticed a couple of days ago, a strange (but not painful) sensation in the neck, slurred speech, and new onset of wheezing; these symptoms have remained stable without improvement or worsening. The patient denied difficulty swallowing, changes in eating or drinking, and reported no recent changes in foods, medications, or dental products. No specific triggers for the neck sensation or wheezing were identified. The doctor noted that the combination of tongue swelling, slurred speech, and wheezing is concerning for possible airway involvement, and discussed potential causes such as allergic reactions or medication side effects, though no new exposures were reported. The doctor advised close monitoring for worsening swelling, increased breathing difficulty, or trouble swallowing, and recommended avoiding potential irritants like spicy foods or mouthwashes. The patient was instructed to track symptom changes and report any new triggers or worsening symptoms promptly.
