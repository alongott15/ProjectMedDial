## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks relevant, logical questions about the onset, progression, and associated symptoms of tongue swelling, including neck sensation, speech changes, swallowing, triggers, and breathing. The patient responses are plausible and match the documented symptoms. The doctor's reasoning and advice are appropriate for a mild case with airway symptoms but no acute deterioration. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe interventions are introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could specify the exact duration of symptoms if possible, and mention any history of similar episodes.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's questioning and explanations are thorough and empathetic. For improvement, the doctor could clarify whether the patient has any history of angioedema or allergies, and briefly review current medications for known triggers.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between symptom exploration and safety advice. To enhance realism, a brief summary or plan (e.g., monitoring instructions or follow-up) could be added at the end.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate for a mild case but could be strengthened by explicitly advising when to seek urgent care (e.g., if breathing worsens or swallowing becomes difficult). Clarity is good throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What has been bothering you the most lately?

**Patient**: My tongue has been swelling up, and it's really been bothering me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the swelling—when did you first notice your tongue feeling this way?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly, but I think I first noticed the swelling a couple of days ago.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other sensations—have you noticed any changes in your neck, such as tightness or discomfort, along with the swelling?

**Patient**: Yes, I've had a strange feeling in my neck along with the swollen tongue. It’s not painful, but it does feel a bit unusual.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your speech—have you noticed any changes, like difficulty speaking clearly or slurring your words, since the swelling began?

**Patient**: Yes, I have noticed some slurred speech since my tongue started swelling. It’s a bit harder to speak clearly than usual.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has the swelling and unusual sensation in your neck been getting better, worse, or staying about the same since you first noticed it?

**Patient**: The swelling and that odd feeling in my neck have pretty much stayed the same since I first noticed them. They haven’t really gotten better or worse.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask—have you had any difficulty swallowing or changes in your ability to eat or drink since this started?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any trouble swallowing or changes with eating or drinking since this started.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about possible triggers—have you recently started any new foods, medications, or dental products before this swelling began? Sometimes changes like these can lead to reactions in the mouth.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t started any new foods or dental products. As for medications, I’ve been taking the same ones for a while now.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since your speech has been affected, have you noticed any changes in your breathing, such as feeling short of breath or noisy breathing, at any point since the swelling began?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve had some wheezing since the swelling started. My breathing hasn’t felt quite normal.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your tongue swelling, changes in speech, and new onset of wheezing are important symptoms to pay attention to. Swelling in the mouth and throat area can sometimes be caused by allergic reactions, medication side effects, or local irritation, but you haven’t started anything new recently. The fact that your breathing feels abnormal and you’re experiencing wheezing makes this more concerning, as these can be signs that the airway is being affected.

While your symptoms have stayed stable and you haven’t had trouble swallowing, any combination of tongue swelling and breathing changes should be monitored closely. If at any point you notice the swelling getting worse, increased difficulty breathing, or trouble swallowing, it’s important to seek medical attention promptly.

For now, I recommend avoiding any potential irritants—such as spicy foods or mouthwashes—and keeping track of any changes in your symptoms. If you notice any triggers that seem to make the swelling or breathing worse, let me know. Would you say anything in particular seems to bring on the strange feeling in your neck or the wheezing?

**Patient**: Nothing in particular seems to bring on the strange feeling in my neck or the wheezing. It just sort of happens along with the tongue swelling and slurred speech. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly—it helps me feel a bit more at ease.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 79-year-old female presenting with acute tongue swelling that began earlier in the evening. She reported waking up with a strange neck sensation and a swollen tongue, but denied chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, rash, or itching. Her history includes atrial fibrillation, hypertension, depression, hypercholesterolemia, and questionable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; she had been taking lisinopril since August of the previous year and has a Bactrim allergy. On examination, her tongue was visibly swollen with slurred speech, but there was no stridor or respiratory distress. The documented diagnosis was angioedema, most likely secondary to ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) use. Treatment included discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor, administration of intravenous steroids and H2 blockers, observation in the ICU, and initiation of Benadryl and famotidine; she was discharged with an EpiPen and instructions for emergency use if symptoms recurred. Additional management included starting amlodipine for hypertension and resuming warfarin for atrial fibrillation. The patient was stable at discharge and advised to follow up with her primary care physician and allergy specialist.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with the chief complaint of tongue swelling that began approximately two days ago. Key symptoms include persistent tongue swelling, a strange (but not painful) sensation in the neck, slurred speech, and new onset of wheezing; the patient denies difficulty swallowing or changes in eating or drinking. The symptoms have remained stable without improvement or worsening, and there are no identified triggers such as new foods, medications, or dental products. The patient has not started any new medications and reports no recent exposures.

The clinical impression is concern for possible airway involvement due to the combination of tongue swelling and breathing changes, though a specific diagnosis is not documented. The treatment plan includes close monitoring for worsening symptoms, avoidance of potential irritants (such as spicy foods or mouthwashes), and instructions to seek prompt medical attention if swelling increases, breathing becomes more difficult, or swallowing is affected. The patient is also advised to track any changes or triggers related to their symptoms.
