## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks relevant, open-ended questions about the patient's symptoms (dizziness, right-sided weakness, shoulder pain, confusion), and the patient provides plausible, detailed responses. The conversation stays focused on mild, intermittent symptoms and does not introduce unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events. The doctor offers appropriate reassurance and advice for symptom monitoring and gentle shoulder exercises, matching the light case context. There are no obvious hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and realistic. For improvement, occasional more specific descriptions (e.g., duration of spells, impact on daily life) could add depth.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor maintains a supportive and thorough approach. To improve, could briefly summarize key points or next steps at the end for clarity and patient understanding.

**Conversation Flow**: Dialogue flows logically, with each turn building on previous information. Consider slightly shorter exchanges or summarizing after several turns to avoid repetition.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns detected. Clarity is good; doctor appropriately advises monitoring for worsening symptoms and provides practical advice for shoulder pain. Ensure written instructions are clear and accessible for older adults.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, especially regarding any episodes of dizziness or changes you've noticed on your right side?

**Patient**: Well... lately I've been feeling a bit dizzy, especially when I lean forward. And sometimes I notice some odd feelings on my right side, but I'm not sure what to make of it.

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing that with me—it sounds uncomfortable. Can you describe more about the odd feelings on your right side, such as whether it's numbness, tingling, weakness, or something else?

**Patient**: Um... I guess it's more like weakness on my right side, not really numbness or tingling. And my shoulder has been hurting since a procedure, but I'm not sure if that's related.

**Doctor**: Thank you for explaining that—weakness and shoulder pain can be concerning, especially after a procedure. Can you tell me if the dizziness or right-sided weakness comes and goes, or if it has been constant lately?

**Patient**: Well... the dizziness and weakness on my right side kind of come and go, they aren't there all the time. I think the episodes are sort of brief, like little spells. The dizziness is worse when I lean forward.

**Doctor**: Thank you for describing these brief spells of dizziness and weakness—it’s understandable to feel concerned. When you experience these episodes, do you also notice any changes in your speech, vision, or ability to move your right arm or leg?

**Patient**: Um... I haven't really noticed any changes in my speech or vision during those spells. My right arm and leg just feel a bit weaker for a short time, but I can still move them.

**Doctor**: Thank you for clarifying that—it's helpful to know you can still move your arm and leg during these spells. Have you noticed if these episodes of dizziness and weakness are triggered by specific activities or positions, such as standing up quickly or turning your head?

**Patient**: Well... I think the dizziness is worse when I lean forward, but I haven't noticed it happening when I stand up quickly or turn my head. The weakness just sort of comes and goes, not really tied to anything I do.

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing these details—it’s understandable to feel unsure when symptoms come and go. Have you noticed any recent changes in your balance or any falls when you’ve experienced these dizzy spells or right-sided weakness?

**Patient**: Well... I haven't had any falls, but sometimes I do feel a bit off balance during those dizzy spells. And, um, I guess I've felt a little confused or disoriented at times—maybe even a bit delirious. Is that normal?

**Doctor**: Thank you for letting me know about the confusion and feeling off balance—that can be unsettling. When you feel confused or disoriented, does it happen at the same time as the dizziness and weakness, or do these symptoms occur separately?

**Patient**: Well... I think the confusion and slight delirium usually happen around the same time as the dizziness and weakness, but not always. Sometimes it's just one or the other. Should I be worried about that?

**Doctor**: I understand your concern—brief episodes of weakness and dizziness can be unsettling. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to perform daily tasks, such as walking, dressing, or using your hands, during or after these spells?

**Patient**: Well... I haven't really had trouble with things like walking or dressing, even after those spells. My shoulder pain makes it a bit harder to use that arm sometimes, but otherwise I can still do my usual tasks. Is there anything I should watch out for?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing all these details—it sounds like your episodes of dizziness and brief right-sided weakness may be related to changes in blood flow or nerve function, possibly similar to transient ischemic attacks, especially since they come and go. Have you noticed any new or worsening headaches, or any changes in your ability to concentrate recently?

**Patient**: Um... I haven't noticed any new or worsening headaches, and I don't think my ability to concentrate has changed much. It's mostly just the dizziness, weakness, and sometimes feeling a bit confused or disoriented. Should I be doing something different to help with these symptoms?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing your symptoms; your brief episodes of dizziness, right-sided weakness, and occasional confusion could be related to changes in blood flow or mild nerve issues, especially since they come and go and are worse when leaning forward. It’s understandable to feel concerned, and I recommend monitoring for any new symptoms like persistent weakness or speech changes. Have you noticed if staying hydrated or changing your posture helps reduce the dizziness?

**Patient**: Well... I haven't really noticed much difference with staying hydrated or changing my posture, the dizziness still comes and goes. I haven't had any speech changes or persistent weakness. Is there anything else I should be doing to help with these symptoms?

**Doctor**: Based on what you’ve shared, your symptoms of brief dizziness, right-sided weakness, and occasional confusion seem to come and go without persistent problems in daily activities, which is reassuring. It’s important to continue monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, sleep, or mood since these episodes began?

**Patient**: Um... I haven't really noticed any changes in my appetite, sleep, or mood. It's mostly just the dizziness, weakness, shoulder pain, and sometimes confusion or slight delirium. Is there anything I should be worried about with these symptoms?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing your concerns—your symptoms are currently mild and intermittent, which is reassuring, but it’s important to keep monitoring for any changes. I recommend continuing to note when these episodes occur and if they become more frequent or severe, and please let me know if you develop persistent weakness, speech changes, or difficulty with daily activities. Would you like advice on gentle exercises or strategies to help manage your shoulder pain?

**Patient**: Well... yes, I’d appreciate some advice on gentle exercises or ways to help with my shoulder pain. It’s been bothering me since the procedure, and I’m not sure what’s safe to try.

**Doctor**: Based on what you’ve shared, your shoulder pain after the procedure may benefit from gentle range-of-motion exercises, such as slowly lifting your arm forward and to the side within a comfortable range, and using a warm compress for relief. Please avoid any movements that cause sharp pain or strain. Would you like written instructions or a demonstration of these gentle exercises?

**Patient**: Well... written instructions would be helpful, thank you. I just want to make sure I’m doing the exercises safely, since my shoulder pain has been bothering me since the procedure. And, um, is it normal to still have some slight confusion or disorientation with these other symptoms?

**Doctor**: It’s understandable to feel concerned about ongoing shoulder pain and occasional confusion; mild, brief episodes of disorientation can sometimes occur with dizziness, especially in older adults, but it’s important to monitor for any worsening or new symptoms. I’ll provide written instructions for gentle shoulder exercises you can safely try at home. Have you noticed if your shoulder pain is improving, staying the same, or getting worse since the procedure?

**Patient**: Well... my shoulder pain has mostly stayed the same since the procedure, it hasn’t really gotten better or worse. I haven’t had any new symptoms like speech changes or trouble with daily activities. Is it normal for the pain to last this long?

**Doctor**: It’s understandable to be concerned about shoulder pain that hasn’t improved since your procedure—sometimes discomfort can persist for several weeks, especially if the area is still healing. Gentle exercises and avoiding strain may help, but if the pain worsens or limits your movement, please let me know. Would you like to discuss ways to manage pain during daily activities?

**Patient**: Well... yes, I’d like to know some ways to manage the pain during my daily activities. It’s mostly just my shoulder that bothers me, and sometimes I feel a bit dizzy or confused too, but I haven’t had any trouble with speech or vision. Is there anything simple I can do at home?

**Doctor**: Based on what you’ve shared, your shoulder pain may benefit from gentle movement, using a warm compress, and pacing activities to avoid strain; for dizziness and brief confusion, continue monitoring for any changes and rise slowly from sitting or leaning positions. It’s reassuring you haven’t had speech or vision changes. Would you like advice on how to safely modify daily tasks to reduce shoulder discomfort?

**Patient**: Well... yes, I’d appreciate some advice on how to change my daily tasks so my shoulder doesn’t hurt as much. And, um, should I be worried about the slight confusion and dizziness I’ve been having?

## EHR Summary

An 84-year-old woman was admitted for management of significant carotid artery stenosis. Her main complaint included prior transient ischemic attacks affecting the right side and dizziness when leaning forward. She had a documented diagnosis of 80–90% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery, as well as greater than 70% stenosis of the left vertebral artery and left internal carotid artery stenosis. The patient underwent stenting of the right internal carotid artery during this admission. The procedure was tolerated well without complications, and she remained afebrile with stable vital signs postoperatively. She received Heparin post-procedure, which was discontinued after six hours. She was monitored in the ICU and Post Anesthesia Care Unit due to bed availability. No additional symptoms or complications were noted during her hospital stay.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient reported brief episodes of dizziness, especially when leaning forward, and intermittent weakness on the right side, along with shoulder pain following a procedure. Occasional confusion or slight delirium was also mentioned, sometimes occurring with the dizzy spells. The doctor asked about the nature and timing of these symptoms, including any changes in speech, vision, balance, daily activities, appetite, sleep, or mood; no persistent problems or new symptoms were noted. The doctor suggested that the symptoms could be related to changes in blood flow or mild nerve issues, possibly similar to transient ischemic attacks, but found it reassuring that daily activities were not affected and no persistent deficits were present. Advice was given to monitor for any new or worsening symptoms such as persistent weakness or speech changes. For shoulder pain, the doctor recommended gentle range-of-motion exercises and using a warm compress, while avoiding movements that cause sharp pain. Additional advice included pacing activities and modifying daily tasks to reduce shoulder discomfort. Written instructions for exercises were offered, and the patient was encouraged to continue monitoring symptoms and report any changes.
