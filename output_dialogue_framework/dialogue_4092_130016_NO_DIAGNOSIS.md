## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the fall, neurological symptoms, and functional impact, and provides a reasonable summary and safety advice. The patient responses align with the documented symptoms and diagnoses. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe interventions introduced. The conversation maintains a primary-care tone and avoids ICU-level or incoherent content.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For added realism, the patient could mention if anyone witnessed the fall or if there were any other injuries (if prompted).

**Doctor Side**: Doctor could clarify the urgency of evaluation (e.g., 'I recommend you be seen within the next day or two') and specify what kind of evaluation (e.g., 'by your primary care doctor or in an urgent care setting').

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and builds on previous answers. To improve, the doctor could summarize key points before giving recommendations, and check for understanding at the end.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate. For clarity, the doctor could explicitly mention that worsening symptoms may require emergency attention (e.g., 'If any of these symptoms develop suddenly, call 911 or go to the emergency room').

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately? Is there anything new or concerning that you'd like to talk about?

**Patient**: Yes, I actually had a fall recently, and since then I've noticed I'm not quite myself. That's what has me a bit concerned.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your fall—when did this happen, and can you describe what you mean by not feeling quite yourself since then?

**Patient**: I don't remember exactly when it happened, but since the fall I've noticed my mind feels a bit foggy. It's harder to remember things in the short term, and I just don't feel quite as sharp as usual.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your day-to-day activities—has this change in how you're feeling made it harder for you to do things like cooking, reading, or managing your usual routines?

**Patient**: Yes, it's definitely made things harder. My right side feels weak, especially my leg, so I struggle more with getting around and doing my usual chores.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your right-sided weakness—did it come on immediately after the fall, or did it develop gradually over time?

**Patient**: It came on right after the fall. I noticed my right side felt weaker almost immediately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your mobility—are you able to walk on your own, or do you need help or support to get around now?

**Patient**: I need help getting around now. My right leg feels weak, so walking on my own has been pretty difficult since the fall.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your thinking and memory—have you noticed any changes in your ability to find words, recognize people, or understand what's happening around you? Or is it mostly just feeling less sharp than usual?

**Patient**: I haven't had trouble finding words or recognizing people. It's mostly just that my short-term memory is worse, and I feel less sharp than usual.

**Doctor**: Alright. Since your symptoms started right after the fall, have you had any headaches, changes in vision, or episodes of feeling dizzy since then?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any headaches, vision changes, or dizziness since the fall. It's mainly the weakness on my right side and trouble with my short-term memory.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you try to use your right leg or arm, does the weakness get worse with activity, or does it stay about the same throughout the day?

**Patient**: The weakness stays about the same all day. Using my right leg or arm doesn't really make it worse, it's just always there since the fall.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, it sounds like the changes in your memory and difficulty with movement started right after your fall, without other symptoms like headaches or dizziness. When someone develops these kinds of changes immediately following a fall, it can sometimes be due to an injury to the brain or nerves that control movement and thinking. It's reassuring that you haven't noticed problems with speech, recognizing people, or vision, but the combination of new memory issues and difficulty moving one side of your body is important to pay attention to.

Often, these symptoms are related to how the brain was affected during the fall. Sometimes, even if there wasn't a major injury at the time, effects can show up afterward. Since these changes are impacting your ability to get around and do daily tasks, I recommend you have a thorough evaluation soon. This would help rule out any serious problems and guide the best way to support your recovery.

In the meantime, try to rest and ask for help with activities that feel unsafe or too difficult. If you notice any new symptoms—like worsening confusion, trouble speaking, sudden severe headache, or loss of consciousness—those would be reasons to seek medical attention right away.

Let me know if you’d like more information about what might be going on or how to stay safe until you’re able to be seen.

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining all that. I understand why you want me to get checked out soon. Is there anything specific I should watch for in case things change before my appointment?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 72-year-old woman presenting after a fall three to seven days prior, with subsequent change in mental status and right-sided weakness. She has a history of dementia. On evaluation, she was found to have a large left frontotemporoparietal subdural hematoma with a 2 cm midline shift on head CT, associated with right-sided drift and lower extremity weakness. Bedside drainage of the subdural hematoma was performed without complications, and follow-up imaging showed good evacuation. Her neurological deficits resolved post-procedure, though she continued to have poor short-term memory due to underlying dementia. The documented diagnosis was left subdural hematoma secondary to trauma. She was discharged in stable condition with instructions for 24-hour supervision at home, follow-up with neurosurgery in one month, and repeat head CT. Discharge medications included trazodone 25 mg as needed and famotidine 20 mg twice daily.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with concerns following a recent fall. Since the fall, they report persistent right-sided weakness—especially in the leg—making mobility and daily activities difficult, as well as new short-term memory problems and feeling less mentally sharp. The weakness began immediately after the fall and remains constant throughout the day; there are no associated headaches, vision changes, dizziness, speech difficulties, or problems recognizing people. Relevant history regarding prior medical conditions, medications, or allergies is not specified. The clinical impression is that these symptoms may be due to injury to the brain or nerves controlling movement and cognition as a result of the fall. The doctor recommends a thorough evaluation soon to rule out serious problems and guide recovery. The patient is advised to rest, seek help with difficult activities, and monitor for new symptoms such as worsening confusion, trouble speaking, severe headache, or loss of consciousness, which would warrant immediate medical attention.
