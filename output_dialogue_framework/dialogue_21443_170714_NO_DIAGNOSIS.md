## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile and symptoms of severe sore throat, odynophagia, drooling, vomiting, high fever, and hoarse voice. The doctor asks appropriate, logical questions to clarify the severity and progression of symptoms. The explanation and recommendations are plausible for a primary care setting, with appropriate escalation advice for warning signs. There are no hallucinations or unsupported content; the reasoning is grounded in the presented case.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and appropriately expresses concern and understanding. For even greater realism, the patient could mention difficulty swallowing saliva or describe the vomiting in more detail.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. To further improve, the doctor could explicitly mention epiglottitis as a possible cause given the red-flag symptoms, or ask about breathing difficulty or stridor directly, as these are critical in this context.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between history-taking, assessment, and advice. The offer to explain what to expect at the visit is a nice touch for patient-centered care.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety is well addressed with clear escalation instructions for urgent symptoms. The doctor could reinforce the urgency of seeking care today given the inability to swallow and drooling, which are red flags for airway compromise.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what's been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: My throat is really sore and it hurts a lot when I try to swallow. That’s the main thing that’s been bothering me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when this started—how long have you been dealing with the sore throat?

**Patient**: I'm not totally sure, but I think it's been a couple of days now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed any fever, cough, or changes in your voice along with the throat pain?

**Patient**: Yeah, I’ve had a high fever and my voice sounds pretty hoarse. I haven’t had any cough though.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about eating and drinking—does swallowing food or liquids make the pain worse, or is it about the same as when your throat is at rest?

**Patient**: Swallowing anything makes the pain a lot worse, honestly. Even water is really hard to get down right now.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any swelling in your neck or any tender lumps under your jaw recently?

**Patient**: I haven’t noticed any swelling or lumps in my neck. It’s mostly just the pain and trouble swallowing.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much is this affecting your daily activities—are you able to work, eat, and sleep as usual, or has it made things more difficult?

**Patient**: It's definitely made things harder. I can't really eat or drink much, and I've been vomiting too. Sleeping has been tough because of the throat pain.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have your symptoms been getting better, worse, or staying about the same since they started a couple of days ago?

**Patient**: They’ve actually been getting worse. Now I can’t swallow solids or liquids at all, and I’ve been drooling because it hurts too much to even swallow my spit.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your temperature—do you know how high your fever has been, or have you measured it at home?

**Patient**: I haven’t actually checked my temperature at home, but it feels pretty high. I’ve been sweating and feeling really hot.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms—severe throat pain, difficulty swallowing even liquids, drooling, hoarse voice, high fever, and worsening over the past couple of days—suggest a more significant throat infection or inflammation. Sometimes, intense pain and inability to swallow can indicate something like tonsillitis or possibly an abscess near the throat area.

What often happens in these cases is that swelling or infection makes it very hard to eat, drink, or even manage saliva. The fact that you're unable to swallow at all and are drooling is concerning, because it means your throat is quite inflamed.

Given how much this is affecting your ability to eat, drink, and sleep—and since things are getting worse rather than better—it's important to get checked in person soon. Dehydration is a real risk if you can't take in fluids. While many sore throats are viral and improve on their own, severe cases like yours sometimes need prescription medication or further evaluation.

If you notice any difficulty breathing, severe neck swelling, or feel faint, those would be warning signs to seek urgent care immediately.

For now, try to sip small amounts of water if you can tolerate it, and rest as much as possible. Avoid irritants like hot drinks or spicy foods. But with your current symptoms, I recommend you see a healthcare provider today for a thorough exam and treatment plan.

Would you like advice on what to expect during an in-person visit?

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that—it helps me understand what’s going on. I’d appreciate some advice on what to expect at the visit, just so I know what might happen. Also, is there anything I should bring or do before I go in?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 29-year-old female presenting with sore throat and odynophagia that worsened over two days, leading to inability to swallow solids or liquids and drooling. She developed vomiting and a hoarse voice, but denied cough, coryza, headache, or respiratory compromise. Her past medical history includes anxiety and eczema, and she takes Aldactone for acne and Celexa for anxiety, with no known drug allergies. On examination, she had a high-grade fever, dry mucous membranes, and was found by ENT to have massive edematous, red, inflamed epiglottis with bilateral adenoid swelling and airway compromise. The documented diagnosis was acute epiglottitis. Treatment included Unasyn (ampicillin/sulbactam) and Decadron (dexamethasone), with improvement in her ability to swallow secretions and resolution of systemic symptoms. She was monitored for airway stability and showed clinical improvement prior to discharge.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with severe sore throat and pain on swallowing as the chief complaint. Symptoms included high fever (not measured but described as feeling very hot and sweating), hoarse voice, inability to swallow solids or liquids, worsening pain over the past couple of days, vomiting, difficulty eating and drinking, trouble sleeping due to throat pain, and drooling because swallowing saliva was too painful. The patient denied cough, neck swelling, or tender lumps under the jaw. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. The doctor noted the absence of neck swelling and the presence of severe throat pain, hoarseness, drooling, and inability to swallow as concerning clinical findings. Assessment was that the symptoms suggested a significant throat infection or inflammation, possibly tonsillitis or a peritonsillar abscess. The doctor recommended urgent in-person evaluation due to risk of dehydration and severity of symptoms, advised sipping small amounts of water if possible, resting, and avoiding irritants, and warned to seek immediate care if breathing difficulty, severe neck swelling, or faintness occurred.
