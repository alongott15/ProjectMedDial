## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the onset, severity, and associated symptoms of shortness of breath and abnormal menses, and the patient responds in a realistic manner. The doctor provides reasonable reassurance and advice for a mild case, referencing stress and hormonal changes as possible contributors, which fits the context. No unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments are introduced, and the conversation remains focused on the patient's reported symptoms.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For added realism, the patient could mention any previous experiences with similar symptoms or reference their known ASD history if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's history of ASD (even if status post closure) to demonstrate awareness of cardiac background, but otherwise reasoning and advice are appropriate for a mild case.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between symptom exploration and advice. The closing summary and invitation for further questions is well-handled.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The doctor appropriately advises when to seek urgent care for worsening symptoms. For clarity, a brief mention that the ASD has been closed and is unlikely to be causing current symptoms would further reassure the patient.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome! What brings you in today, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having a hard time catching my breath lately, and it kind of feels like I'm suffocating sometimes. That's mainly why I wanted to get checked out.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long this has been going on—when did you first notice these breathing difficulties?

**Patient**: I'm not totally sure, but I think it's been a few days now. The shortness of breath just kind of showed up and hasn't really gone away.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your day-to-day—are these breathing difficulties making it hard for you to do normal activities, like walking or talking?

**Patient**: Yeah, it's definitely making things tougher. Even just walking around or talking too much makes me feel out of breath.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the feeling of suffocation—does it come on suddenly or build up gradually? And do you ever notice it happening more at rest, during activity, or at night?

**Patient**: It usually builds up gradually, not all of a sudden. I notice it more when I'm moving around, but sometimes even when I'm just sitting, I get that suffocating feeling.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this, like chest pain, wheezing, cough, or swelling in your legs or feet?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any chest pain, wheezing, cough, or swelling. One thing I have noticed is my periods have been kind of abnormal lately.

**Doctor**: Alright. Can you tell me more about what’s been unusual with your periods—are they heavier, lighter, coming more often, or have you missed any?

**Patient**: My periods have been kind of irregular—sometimes they come late, and other times they're lighter than usual. I haven't missed one completely, but the timing and flow just seem off compared to what I'm used to.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your energy levels—have you been feeling more tired than usual, or noticed any dizziness or lightheadedness? Sometimes these can be related to changes in your breathing and periods.

**Patient**: I haven't felt more tired than usual, and I haven't had any dizziness or lightheadedness. It's mainly just the breathing issues and my periods being off.

**Doctor**: Alright. Does anything seem to trigger or worsen your breathing difficulty—like certain environments, stress, or specific activities? Or does it happen randomly?

**Patient**: Stress definitely makes it worse, and physical activity too. Sometimes it just pops up randomly when I'm not really doing anything, but it's more noticeable when I'm stressed out or moving around.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your breathing difficulties are most noticeable with stress and activity, and you've also had some changes in your menstrual cycle. These symptoms can sometimes be linked—stress, for example, can affect both breathing and periods. Other common causes for these symptoms might include mild anxiety, changes in routine, or even hormonal fluctuations.

The fact that you aren't having chest pain, wheezing, or swelling is reassuring. However, since this is affecting your daily life and feels uncomfortable, it's worth keeping an eye on. If you ever develop new symptoms like severe shortness of breath at rest, chest pain, fainting, or if your periods stop completely for several months, those would be reasons to seek care more urgently.

For now, focusing on stress management—like regular exercise (as tolerated), relaxation techniques, or talking to someone about stress—may help both your breathing and periods. If your symptoms persist or worsen, or if you notice any new changes, it would be a good idea to follow up for further evaluation.

Does this explanation make sense, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss about your symptoms?

**Patient**: Thanks, that does make sense. I’ll try some of those stress management things you mentioned. If anything new pops up or it gets worse, I’ll definitely reach out.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 24-year-old female presenting with shortness of breath and a feeling of suffocation. Symptoms had been ongoing for approximately one year prior to admission. Her past medical history includes borderline high cholesterol, gastroesophageal reflux disease, heartburn, abnormal menses, and a history of feeling suffocated; she takes Celexa as needed and is allergic to Sudafed. On physical exam, she was afebrile, stable, and in no acute distress, with a 3/6 murmur at the left lower sternal border but otherwise normal findings. Workup revealed an atrial septal defect (ASD). She underwent minimally invasive ASD repair during this admission. Postoperatively, she required increased oxygen and was found to have a large pleural effusion but no pulmonary embolism; she was treated with diuretics, chest physical therapy, Percocet for pain, and low-dose beta blockers, resulting in improved oxygen saturation.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with difficulty catching her breath and a sensation of suffocation. She reported that the shortness of breath began a few days ago, is persistent, and worsens with physical activity and stress, though it can also occur at rest; she finds it challenging to walk or talk without becoming out of breath. She denied chest pain, wheezing, cough, swelling in her legs or feet, fatigue, dizziness, or lightheadedness. Additionally, she noted her menstrual periods have become irregular, with changes in timing and lighter flow, but no missed periods. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. The doctor found the absence of chest pain and other concerning symptoms reassuring and assessed that her breathing difficulties and menstrual changes may be linked to stress, mild anxiety, or hormonal fluctuations. The doctor recommended stress management strategies such as regular exercise (as tolerated), relaxation techniques, and seeking support, with instructions to follow up if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
