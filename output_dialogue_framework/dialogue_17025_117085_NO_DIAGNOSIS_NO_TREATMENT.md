## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: UNREALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.600
- **Justification**: The dialogue is generally plausible for a primary care visit regarding a new oral lump with mild symptoms. However, the patient profile explicitly lists a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth, which is not acknowledged or addressed by the doctor at any point. Instead, the doctor discusses benign causes and suggests monitoring, which would be inappropriate if the diagnosis of carcinoma is already known. This is a significant omission and constitutes an unsupported minimization of the case's seriousness.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient's responses are clear and consistent with the symptoms described in the profile. However, if the patient is already aware of a cancer diagnosis, it would be realistic for them to reference this or express concern about recurrence or follow-up.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor should acknowledge the existing diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and tailor their assessment and recommendations accordingly. Discussing benign causes and suggesting simple monitoring is inappropriate in the context of a known malignancy.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and clear for an undiagnosed oral lump, but it fails to incorporate the critical context of a cancer diagnosis, leading to unrealistic clinical reasoning.

**Safety Or Clarity**: There is a safety concern due to the minimization of a known cancer diagnosis. The conversation should include discussion of cancer surveillance, possible recurrence, or post-surgical complications rather than reassurance about benign causes.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what's been going on or any concerns you've noticed recently?

**Patient**: I've noticed a lump in the floor of my mouth, and it's got me a bit concerned. That's really the main thing that's been bothering me lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the lump—when did you first notice it, and has it changed in size or feel since then?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when I first noticed it—maybe a few days ago. It doesn't seem to have changed much in size or feel since then.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other changes—have you noticed discomfort, pain, or difficulty swallowing or speaking since this started?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve had a bit of trouble swallowing since this started. There’s also some redness around where the lump is. I haven’t really noticed any pain or issues speaking.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does eating or drinking make the swallowing difficulty or the redness any better or worse?

**Patient**: Eating and drinking don’t seem to make it much better or worse. The mild trouble swallowing is just sort of there, regardless of what I’m doing.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or drainage from the area where the lump is?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any numbness, tingling, or drainage from that area. It’s mainly just the lump, the redness, and mild trouble swallowing.

**Doctor**: Got it. Are you able to move your tongue normally, or does the lump make it difficult to move your tongue around?

**Patient**: I can move my tongue normally. The lump hasn’t made it difficult to move it around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall health—have you had any recent fevers or felt generally unwell since noticing the lump?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any fevers or felt unwell overall since noticing the lump. It’s really just those symptoms in my mouth.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has the size or firmness of the lump changed at all over the past few days, or has it stayed pretty much the same since you first noticed it?

**Patient**: The lump has pretty much stayed the same since I first noticed it. I haven’t felt any difference in size or firmness over the past few days.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you have a lump in the floor of your mouth with some surrounding redness and mild trouble swallowing, but no pain, drainage, or issues moving your tongue. The lump hasn’t changed much over several days, and you’re otherwise feeling well.

What often happens in cases like this is that a lump in the floor of the mouth could be due to a minor salivary gland issue, like a blocked duct (sometimes called a ranula or mucocele), or even something simple like localized irritation. The fact that you don’t have pain, drainage, or systemic symptoms is somewhat reassuring, but the persistence of the lump and redness means it’s worth keeping an eye on.

At this point, I’d recommend monitoring for any changes—such as rapid growth, increasing redness, pain, fever, or difficulty moving your tongue or opening your mouth. If you notice any of those signs, it’s important to seek care promptly. In the meantime, maintaining good oral hygiene and avoiding irritation (like very hot foods or sharp objects) can help.

If the lump doesn’t improve or starts to get worse over the next week or so, seeing a dentist or oral health specialist for a closer look would be a good next step. Sometimes these lumps resolve on their own, but persistent ones should be evaluated to rule out anything more concerning.

Does this sound manageable for you right now? And is the lump interfering with eating or speaking in any way that’s making day-to

**Patient**: That sounds reasonable to me. The lump isn’t really interfering with eating or speaking—just mild trouble swallowing. I’ll keep an eye on it and let you know if anything changes. Thanks for explaining everything clearly.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 54-year-old male presenting for surgical management of a mass in the floor of the mouth. He reported noticing the mass prior to admission, which was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth. He has no other past medical history and no pertinent family history. The documented diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth. Treatment included resection of the floor of the mouth with mandibulectomy, bilateral neck dissection, tooth extraction, tracheostomy placement, and reconstruction with a free radial osseocutaneous flap. Postoperatively, he developed mild dysphagia and erythema around his incision, for which he was treated with tube feeds, then a puree diet, and a course of Keflex. At discharge, his nasogastric and tracheostomy tubes had been removed, and he was prescribed Keflex, Roxicet, Prilosec, and thickened meals. He was advised to follow up with surgery and plastic surgery, and to continue speech therapy and wound care at home.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with a chief complaint of a lump in the floor of the mouth. The lump has been present for several days without significant change in size or firmness and is associated with mild trouble swallowing and localized redness, but no pain, drainage, numbness, tingling, or difficulty moving the tongue. The patient denies fever, systemic symptoms, or interference with eating or speaking. Relevant medical history, medications, and allergies are not specified.

The clinical impression is a possible minor salivary gland issue such as a blocked duct (ranula or mucocele) or localized irritation, with no signs of acute infection or systemic illness. The treatment plan includes monitoring for changes such as rapid growth, increasing redness, pain, fever, or new functional limitations, maintaining good oral hygiene, and avoiding oral irritation. The patient was advised to seek further evaluation if symptoms worsen or persist beyond a week.
