## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, stepwise questions about the patient's symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hematemesis), explores relevant details (appearance of blood, associated symptoms, medication use), and provides reasonable advice for a light case while emphasizing the need for further evaluation. The patient responses are plausible and match the expected symptomatology. There are no obvious hallucinations, contradictions, or role confusion. The conversation is thorough but remains within the bounds of a primary care/light case scenario.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, occasional elaboration on symptom severity or impact on daily life could add realism.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor is thorough and empathetic. To improve, could briefly acknowledge the patient's diabetes history (from profile) and ask about related symptoms (e.g., blood sugar control), since diabetic ketoacidosis is listed as a diagnosis.

**Conversation Flow**: Flow is logical and smooth, with appropriate follow-up questions and explanations. Could be slightly condensed to avoid repetition in reassurance and advice.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate for a simulated light case. The doctor correctly advises monitoring for worsening symptoms and arranging prompt evaluation. No major safety concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, and are you experiencing any issues such as nausea or vomiting?

**Patient**: Well... yeah, I've been feeling pretty nauseous lately. It's been making me pretty uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: I'm sorry to hear that you've been feeling so uncomfortable with nausea. Can you tell me if you've had any vomiting along with the nausea, or is it just the feeling of queasiness?

**Patient**: Um, yeah, I've actually been vomiting too, not just feeling queasy. It's been happening a few times.

**Doctor**: I'm sorry you're dealing with both nausea and vomiting—it sounds quite uncomfortable. Have you noticed any abdominal pain or discomfort along with these symptoms?

**Patient**: Yeah, I have had some abdominal pain too. It kind of comes and goes, but it's definitely there along with the nausea and vomiting.

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing that—abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting can be quite distressing. When you've vomited, have you noticed any blood in your vomit or has it looked unusual in color?

**Patient**: Um... yeah, I did notice some blood in my vomit. That kind of worried me.

**Doctor**: I understand that seeing blood in your vomit can be very concerning. Can you describe whether the blood appeared bright red or more like dark, coffee ground material?

**Patient**: Um... I think it looked more like bright red blood, not really like coffee grounds. It was kind of alarming to see.

**Doctor**: I understand how alarming it must have been to see bright red blood in your vomit. Have you noticed any black or tarry stools, or changes in your bowel movements recently?

**Patient**: Well, I haven't noticed any black or tarry stools, and I don't think my bowel movements have changed. Should I be worried about the blood in my vomit?

**Doctor**: I understand your concern—seeing blood in your vomit can be unsettling. Have you recently taken any medications like aspirin or ibuprofen, or had any issues with heartburn or indigestion?

**Patient**: Well, I haven't taken any aspirin or ibuprofen, and I don't think I've had heartburn or indigestion. Is the blood in my vomit something serious?

**Doctor**: I understand your concern, and it's important to look into any blood in vomit. You mentioned the blood was bright red—have you had any recent coughing fits, throat irritation, or dental issues that might explain bleeding from your mouth or throat?

**Patient**: Um, no, I haven't had any coughing fits, throat irritation, or dental issues. It's just been the nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and then seeing that blood. Should I be doing something different because of this?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing these details—nausea, vomiting with bright red blood, and abdominal pain can sometimes indicate bleeding from the upper digestive tract, a condition called hematemesis. Have you noticed any symptoms like dizziness or feeling faint when standing up?

**Patient**: Well, I haven't really noticed any dizziness or feeling faint when I stand up. It's mostly just been the nausea, vomiting with some bright red blood, and the abdominal pain. Is hematemesis something serious?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing all these details—your symptoms of nausea, vomiting with bright red blood, and abdominal pain do suggest some irritation or bleeding in your upper digestive tract, which can sometimes be serious. Have you noticed if these symptoms are getting worse, staying the same, or improving over time?

**Patient**: Well, I think the symptoms have pretty much stayed the same—they're not really getting worse, but they're not going away either. Should I be worried about this irritation or bleeding?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing your symptoms—persistent nausea, vomiting with bright red blood, and abdominal pain suggest irritation or possible bleeding in your upper digestive tract, which does deserve attention. While your symptoms haven't worsened, it's important to monitor them closely. Have you been able to keep fluids down and stay hydrated despite the vomiting?

**Patient**: Well, I've been able to keep some fluids down, but it's a bit tough with the nausea and vomiting. Is there anything I should be doing to help with this?

**Doctor**: Based on what you've shared—persistent nausea, vomiting with bright red blood, and abdominal pain—it's important to have this evaluated further, as it could indicate irritation or bleeding in your digestive tract. For now, try to sip clear fluids slowly and avoid solid foods until you feel better. Are you able to arrange a visit with your healthcare provider soon for a more thorough assessment?

**Patient**: Yeah, I can arrange to see my healthcare provider soon. Should I be worried about this bleeding in my digestive tract, or is it something that usually gets better on its own?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing your concerns—while mild irritation can sometimes improve on its own, vomiting blood is not typical and should be evaluated by your healthcare provider to rule out any serious causes. In the meantime, continue to sip fluids and monitor your symptoms. Have you noticed any new symptoms since we started talking?

**Patient**: Um, no, I haven't noticed any new symptoms since we started talking. It's still just the nausea, vomiting with some bright red blood, and the abdominal pain. Is there anything specific I should watch out for?

**Doctor**: Based on your symptoms—persistent nausea, vomiting with bright red blood, and abdominal pain—it's important to have this checked by your healthcare provider soon, as bleeding from the digestive tract can sometimes require treatment. In the meantime, watch for signs like increased vomiting, severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or black stools, and seek care promptly if these occur. Are you able to get in touch with your provider if your symptoms worsen?

**Patient**: Yeah, I can get in touch with my provider if things get worse. Thanks for letting me know what to watch out for. Is there anything else I should do while I'm waiting to be seen?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing your symptoms and concerns—while waiting to be seen, continue sipping clear fluids, rest as much as possible, and avoid foods that worsen your nausea. If you notice any worsening symptoms like increased vomiting, severe pain, or black stools, contact your provider promptly. Is there anything else about your symptoms or health that you’d like to discuss today?

## EHR Summary

Summary:

A 62-year-old man with type 2 diabetes was admitted with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain of one day's duration. He experienced an episode of hematemesis in the Emergency Department, prompting evaluation for an upper gastrointestinal bleed. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a nonbleeding tear at the gastroesophageal junction. He was also found to have diabetic ketoacidosis, which was managed with an insulin drip; his anion gap subsequently closed. Metformin was discontinued during admission due to concerns about acidosis, and he was started on subcutaneous heparin. The patient received intravenous Protonix, later transitioned to oral Protonix, and had no further episodes of hematemesis with stable hematocrit. He was discharged home in stable condition.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient reported persistent nausea, vomiting (including episodes with bright red blood), and abdominal pain. The doctor asked about the presence of blood in vomit, its appearance, changes in bowel movements, recent medication use, heartburn, and other possible sources of bleeding such as throat or dental issues; none of these were present except for the described symptoms. The doctor explained that these symptoms could indicate irritation or bleeding in the upper digestive tract (hematemesis) and emphasized the importance of monitoring for worsening symptoms. The patient was advised to sip clear fluids slowly, avoid solid foods until feeling better, and arrange a visit with their healthcare provider for further evaluation. The doctor recommended watching for increased vomiting, severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or black stools, and to seek prompt care if these occurred. The patient confirmed they could contact their provider if symptoms worsened. No new symptoms were reported during the conversation. The doctor reiterated the importance of rest and monitoring while waiting to be seen.
