## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly plausible for a primary-care setting with a patient who has a history of coronary artery disease and recent cardiac intervention. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the chest pain, its characteristics, and associated symptoms. The reasoning is consistent with the patient's profile and the case type, and the advice given is cautious and appropriate for a mild case with concerning cardiac history. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any medications currently taken or clarify if there were any changes in activity or stress levels around the onset of symptoms.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's questioning and explanation are thorough and empathetic. For improvement, the doctor could briefly review current medications or ask about adherence, as this is common in follow-up for cardiac patients.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and smooth, progressing from symptom description to medical history and then to recommendations. The closing is supportive and clear.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate for the scenario. The doctor correctly emphasizes when to seek urgent care and the importance of follow-up. No safety concerns detected.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discomfort you're experiencing—can you describe exactly where you feel the pain or pressure?

**Patient**: The pain and pressure are right in the middle of my chest, sort of behind my breastbone. That's where I feel it most.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the nature of the pain—would you describe it as sharp, dull, squeezing, or burning?

**Patient**: It feels more like a pressure or squeezing, not really sharp or burning. It's just uncomfortable, kind of sits there in my chest.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does this pressure come on with activity, like walking or climbing stairs, or does it happen even when you’re at rest?

**Patient**: It usually gets worse when I’m walking or going up stairs. If I’m just sitting quietly, it’s not as noticeable.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed any shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded when this happens?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any sweating or feeling lightheaded. I don’t really get short of breath either, just the chest pressure.

**Doctor**: Alright. How long does the pressure usually last when it comes on—does it go away quickly, or does it stick around for several minutes or longer?

**Patient**: It usually lasts for several minutes, especially if I keep moving around. If I sit down and rest, it tends to ease up after a while.

**Doctor**: Got it. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most severe discomfort you can imagine, how would you rate this pressure when it’s at its worst?

**Patient**: I’d rate it around a 6 when it’s at its worst. It’s uncomfortable, but not unbearable.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your medical history—have you ever had any heart problems or high blood pressure in the past?

**Patient**: Yes, I have coronary artery disease and high blood pressure. I had a procedure done on my right coronary artery about three weeks ago.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when this started—did you first notice this chest pressure after your recent procedure, or was it present before as well?

**Patient**: I first noticed this chest pressure after my procedure. I don’t remember having it before then.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re experiencing chest pressure that comes on with activity and eases with rest, and this started after your recent heart procedure. In people with your history of coronary artery disease, this type of symptom can sometimes be a sign that the heart muscle isn’t getting enough oxygen during exertion—what we call “angina.” Even though you’re not having other symptoms like shortness of breath or sweating, it’s important to pay attention to these changes, especially after a recent procedure.

What often happens after a procedure is that some discomfort can be normal as your body recovers, but new or persistent chest pressure with activity should be evaluated to make sure everything is healing well and there are no new blockages or issues.

My recommendation is that you reach out to your cardiologist or the team who performed your procedure soon to let them know about these symptoms. If the pressure becomes more severe, lasts longer, or occurs at rest, or if you develop new symptoms like shortness of breath, nausea, or sweating, seek medical attention right away.

In the meantime, try to take it easy and avoid activities that bring on the discomfort. Does that plan sound reasonable to you?

**Patient**: That sounds reasonable to me, thank you for explaining it. I’ll make sure to contact my cardiologist soon. I appreciate you taking the time to go over everything with me.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 77-year-old female presenting with substernal chest pain and pressure for four days, found to have a new myocardial infarction. She has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and recent PTCA to the right coronary artery. Cardiac catheterization revealed significant multi-vessel coronary artery disease with an ejection fraction of 50%. The documented diagnosis was unstable angina, for which she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x3. Postoperatively, she experienced sternal drainage treated briefly with Kefzol, required transfusions for low hematocrit, and was diuresed; her chest tube was discontinued after high output resolved. She was discharged in good condition with no acute problems. The treatment plan included multiple medications: Captopril, Niferex, Lopressor, Protonix, Lipitor, Klonopin, Xalatan, Plavix (for three months), Percocet as needed for pain, Aspirin, Lasix with potassium chloride (for one week), and Colace.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension, presenting with chest pressure as the main complaint. The chest pressure is described as a squeezing sensation located behind the breastbone, rated 6 out of 10 in severity, and is triggered by physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs; it eases with rest and typically lasts several minutes. The patient denies associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness. The chest pressure began after a recent procedure on the right coronary artery performed three weeks ago. The documented clinical impression is angina, likely due to insufficient oxygen delivery to the heart muscle during exertion, especially given the patient’s cardiac history and recent intervention. The physician advised the patient to contact their cardiologist soon for further evaluation and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop. The patient was also instructed to avoid activities that provoke the discomfort in the meantime.
