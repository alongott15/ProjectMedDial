## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about exertional symptoms, differentiates between heartburn and cardiac symptoms, and provides cautious, clear advice given the patient's significant cardiac history. The patient responses are coherent and realistic, and there are no unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments introduced. The conversation maintains a primary-care tone and avoids severe or ICU-level interventions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any medications they are taking or express concerns about their known heart history.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor does well to clarify symptoms and provide safety-netting advice. For completeness, the doctor could briefly review the patient's known cardiac history with the patient or ask about medication adherence and recent follow-ups.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between symptom exploration and advice. A brief summary of the patient's medical background could be woven in for context.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate. The doctor correctly advises caution and follow-up without overreacting or ignoring possible cardiac causes. No clarity concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about any symptoms or concerns you've been having lately?

**Patient**: I've been getting heartburn whenever I do things like walk or go up the stairs. That's the main thing that's been bothering me lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long this has been going on—when did you first notice these symptoms?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been happening for at least a couple of weeks now. I also feel more tired than usual when I'm moving around.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much is this impacting your daily routines—are you finding it difficult to do things you normally would, like errands or light chores?

**Patient**: Yes, it's making things like grocery shopping and even just walking around the house more tiring than usual. I have to take breaks more often now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed chest discomfort, pressure, or pain when you’re active, or is it mainly a burning feeling?

**Patient**: It's mainly a burning feeling, not really pressure or pain. I haven't noticed any discomfort like that, just the heartburn when I'm active.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other changes—have you had any issues like shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded when you're active?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any shortness of breath, sweating, or felt lightheaded when I'm active. It's just the heartburn and feeling more tired than usual.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if eating certain foods or the timing of your meals makes this burning sensation more likely to happen when you're active?

**Patient**: I haven't really noticed a connection with what I eat or when I eat. The burning just seems to come on when I'm moving around, no matter the meal.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how things have changed—would you say these symptoms are staying about the same, getting worse, or improving over the past couple of weeks?

**Patient**: They've been staying about the same. I haven't noticed any big changes—just the same heartburn and tiredness when I'm active.

**Doctor**: Got it. When the burning sensation comes on during activity, does it ever continue after you stop and rest, or does it go away pretty quickly once you sit down?

**Patient**: It usually goes away pretty quickly once I sit down and rest. The burning doesn't really stick around after I stop moving.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re experiencing a burning sensation in your chest that comes on with activity and goes away quickly with rest, along with feeling more tired than usual. While heartburn is often related to acid reflux, the fact that it happens mainly during exertion and isn’t linked to meals makes me want to be a bit cautious. Sometimes, symptoms like these can overlap with signs of heart or circulation issues, especially in people your age.

It’s important to keep an eye on any new or changing symptoms—like if you develop chest pressure, pain, shortness of breath, or if the burning starts happening at rest. For now, I’d recommend taking it easy with physical activity until we know more, and consider checking in with your primary doctor soon for a more thorough evaluation. They may want to do some basic tests to rule out anything concerning.

If you notice any worsening symptoms—such as chest pain, fainting, or sudden shortness of breath—seek medical attention right away. Otherwise, keeping a log of when these episodes happen and what you’re doing at the time may help us figure out the pattern.

Does that all make sense? Any other questions or concerns on your mind?

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I’ll keep track of when it happens and follow up with my doctor. I appreciate your help—if anything changes, I’ll make sure to get it checked out.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 66-year-old male presenting with exertional heartburn and fatigue. He was found to have a low hematocrit and an upper GI bleed caused by a polyp, which was treated with polypectomy, resulting in stabilization. His past medical history includes paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, parotid disease, prior GI bleed, transient ischemic attacks, and renal calculi; he has no known drug allergies. On admission, his medications included Lipitor, digoxin, and Protonix, with Coumadin stopped prior to admission. Cardiac catheterization revealed multi-vessel coronary artery disease following a positive stress test. He underwent a four-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and recovered well postoperatively, including successful ventilator weaning and ambulation assessment by physical therapy. The documented diagnosis was multi-vessel coronary artery disease status post CABG. He was discharged home in stable condition after removal of chest tubes and wires, with recommendations for continued physical activity as tolerated.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with heartburn occurring during physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs. Symptoms have persisted for at least a couple of weeks and include increased tiredness during movement, requiring more frequent breaks; the burning sensation is not associated with chest pressure, pain, shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness, and is not linked to meals or specific foods. The heartburn resolves quickly with rest and has remained stable over the past two weeks. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. On assessment, the doctor noted a burning chest sensation triggered by exertion and cautioned that while this may be related to acid reflux, its activity-related pattern warrants consideration of possible cardiac or circulatory causes. The doctor advised the patient to limit physical activity until further evaluation, keep a symptom log, and follow up with their primary doctor for basic tests. The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or new concerning signs develop.
