## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the patient's symptoms, including onset, progression, associated features, and impact on daily activities. The doctor summarizes findings, provides a plausible differential (mild stroke/TIA vs. other causes), and recommends appropriate next steps without overstepping the light case context. There are no unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments introduced. The patient responses are clear and relevant, and the conversation maintains a logical flow.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and volunteers important information about the episode of confusion. For even greater realism, the patient could express more uncertainty about timing or details, as is common in elderly patients.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's age and history of subdural hematoma as risk factors, or clarify if imaging has already been performed during admission.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and smooth, with appropriate transitions between topics. The doctor summarizes well and checks for understanding. To enhance realism, the conversation could include a brief check on medication changes or recent falls.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns noted. The doctor appropriately advises on warning symptoms and next steps. Clarity is high throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some trouble with my right hand—it feels clumsy and shaky, and I can't seem to cut things like I used to.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the shakiness—does anything in particular seem to trigger it or make it worse, like certain movements or times of day?

**Patient**: I haven't really noticed anything specific that makes it worse. It just seems to happen when I try to use my hand, especially for things like cutting or holding objects.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your right hand or anywhere else?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling. It's mostly just the clumsiness and shaking in my right hand.

**Doctor**: Got it. Can you tell me when you first noticed this problem with your hand and how it's changed since then?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it started, but I noticed it a few days ago and it's been about the same since then. Also, during my admission, I had one episode where I was extremely confused and even a bit combative, but that hasn't happened again.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the headache you mentioned—can you describe what it feels like and where exactly on the left side you notice it?

**Patient**: The headache is on the left side, sort of around my temple. It's not very sharp, more of a dull ache that comes and goes.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this a new type of pain for you?

**Patient**: No, this kind of headache is new for me. I haven't had this type of pain on the left side before.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you had any changes in your vision, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding others since these symptoms started?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any changes in my vision or trouble speaking. I can understand others just fine.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily activities—has this issue with your hand made it difficult to do other things, like buttoning clothes or writing, or is it mainly with tasks that require more coordination?

**Patient**: Yes, it's made buttoning my clothes and writing more difficult too. It seems to affect anything that needs fine coordination.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you're experiencing new difficulty with fine movements in your right hand, along with a dull headache on the left side. These symptoms started recently and have stayed about the same, and you also mentioned an episode of confusion during your admission.

My main concern is that new problems with hand coordination—especially when they come on suddenly, affect one side, and are accompanied by a new headache—can sometimes be related to changes in blood flow to the brain, such as a mild stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). While your symptoms are mild and you haven't had numbness, vision changes, or speech problems, it's important to take new neurological symptoms seriously at your age.

Because these issues can have different causes, such as nerve problems or even medication side effects, I'd recommend we check in with your care team for a closer look—potentially including a neurological exam and possibly some imaging if not already done. In the meantime, please let someone know right away if you notice any new symptoms like weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, or worsening confusion.

Do you have any questions about what might be going on or about the next steps?

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate that you're taking these symptoms seriously. Is there anything I should avoid doing while we wait for more tests?

## EHR Summary

The patient is an 88-year-old female presenting with right hand weakness, clumsiness, and shaking, which developed over the course of a week. Symptoms included inability to pick up objects or cut food with her right hand, following a minor head injury four weeks prior that resulted in a brief period of left-sided headache but no loss of consciousness, nausea, or vomiting. Her medical history includes noninsulin dependent diabetes and congestive heart failure, and she is taking Prevacid, atenolol, K-Ciel, Lasix, and aspirin. On examination, she was alert and oriented with intact cranial nerves, but had trace pronator drift and decreased strength (4/5) in the right upper extremity, slowed coordination on the right, and sensory changes in the right palm. Laboratory results showed mild hyponatremia and elevated creatinine. Head CT revealed a subacute left subdural hematoma with no interval increase. The documented diagnosis was subacute left subdural hematoma. The patient was monitored during admission; specific treatments or interventions were not detailed in the note.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with new-onset clumsiness and shakiness in the right hand, making it difficult to cut things, button clothes, and write. Symptoms began a few days ago and have remained stable; the patient denied numbness, tingling, weakness, vision changes, or speech difficulties. The patient also reported a dull, intermittent headache on the left side near the temple, which is a new type of pain, and described a single episode of extreme confusion and combativeness during admission that has not recurred. No relevant past medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. On examination, there were no additional physical findings described beyond the patient's reported symptoms. The doctor assessed that the combination of new right-hand coordination problems and left-sided headache could indicate a neurological issue such as a mild stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), though other causes like nerve problems or medication side effects were also considered. The doctor recommended further evaluation by the care team, including a neurological exam and possibly imaging, and advised the patient to report any new symptoms such as weakness, numbness, speech difficulties, or worsening confusion immediately.
