## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the patient's symptoms, including onset, progression, associated features, and impact on daily activities. The doctor summarizes findings, provides a plausible differential (mild stroke/TIA vs. other causes), and recommends appropriate next steps without overstepping the light case context. There are no unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments introduced. The patient responses are clear and relevant, and the conversation maintains a logical flow.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and volunteers important information about the episode of confusion. For even greater realism, the patient could express more uncertainty about timing or details, as is common in elderly patients.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's age and history of subdural hematoma as risk factors, or clarify if imaging has already been performed during admission.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and smooth, with appropriate transitions between topics. The doctor summarizes well and checks for understanding. To enhance realism, the conversation could include a brief check on medication changes or recent falls.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns noted. The doctor appropriately advises on warning symptoms and next steps. Clarity is high throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some trouble with my right hand—it feels clumsy and shaky, and I can't seem to cut things like I used to.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the shakiness—does anything in particular seem to trigger it or make it worse, like certain movements or times of day?

**Patient**: I haven't really noticed anything specific that makes it worse. It just seems to happen when I try to use my hand, especially for things like cutting or holding objects.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your right hand or anywhere else?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling. It's mostly just the clumsiness and shaking in my right hand.

**Doctor**: Got it. Can you tell me when you first noticed this problem with your hand and how it's changed since then?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it started, but I noticed it a few days ago and it's been about the same since then. Also, during my admission, I had one episode where I was extremely confused and even a bit combative, but that hasn't happened again.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the headache you mentioned—can you describe what it feels like and where exactly on the left side you notice it?

**Patient**: The headache is on the left side, sort of around my temple. It's not very sharp, more of a dull ache that comes and goes.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this a new type of pain for you?

**Patient**: No, this kind of headache is new for me. I haven't had this type of pain on the left side before.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you had any changes in your vision, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding others since these symptoms started?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any changes in my vision or trouble speaking. I can understand others just fine.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily activities—has this issue with your hand made it difficult to do other things, like buttoning clothes or writing, or is it mainly with tasks that require more coordination?

**Patient**: Yes, it's made buttoning my clothes and writing more difficult too. It seems to affect anything that needs fine coordination.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you're experiencing new difficulty with fine movements in your right hand, along with a dull headache on the left side. These symptoms started recently and have stayed about the same, and you also mentioned an episode of confusion during your admission.

My main concern is that new problems with hand coordination—especially when they come on suddenly, affect one side, and are accompanied by a new headache—can sometimes be related to changes in blood flow to the brain, such as a mild stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). While your symptoms are mild and you haven't had numbness, vision changes, or speech problems, it's important to take new neurological symptoms seriously at your age.

Because these issues can have different causes, such as nerve problems or even medication side effects, I'd recommend we check in with your care team for a closer look—potentially including a neurological exam and possibly some imaging if not already done. In the meantime, please let someone know right away if you notice any new symptoms like weakness, numbness, trouble speaking, or worsening confusion.

Do you have any questions about what might be going on or about the next steps?

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate that you're taking these symptoms seriously. Is there anything I should avoid doing while we wait for more tests?

## EHR Summary

The patient is an 88-year-old woman presenting with right hand clumsiness, weakness, and shaking, following a minor head injury four weeks prior. She initially experienced a week of left-sided headache without nausea or vomiting, and a CT scan revealed a minuscule bleed. Her symptoms progressed to right hand dysfunction, including inability to pick up objects and difficulty cutting food. Relevant history includes noninsulin dependent diabetes and congestive heart failure; medications on admission included Prevacid, atenolol, K-Ciel, Lasix, and aspirin, with no known drug allergies. Head CT on admission showed a subacute left subdural hematoma with no interval increase. During hospitalization, she had one episode of acute confusion and combativeness, which resolved after Haldol administration. The patient was treated with close neurological monitoring, Tylenol for pain, Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and supportive care; she was found to require short-term rehabilitation prior to discharge. She was discharged in stable condition with follow-up arranged in two weeks and a repeat head CT planned.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with new-onset clumsiness and shakiness of the right hand as the chief complaint. Symptoms include difficulty with fine motor tasks such as cutting, buttoning clothes, and writing, without associated numbness, tingling, weakness, vision changes, or speech difficulties. The patient also reports a new, intermittent dull headache localized to the left temple and describes a single episode of confusion and combativeness during admission, which has not recurred. There is no prior history of similar headaches.

The clinical impression is concern for a possible mild stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), given the acute onset of unilateral hand coordination problems and new headache. The physician notes that other causes such as nerve issues or medication side effects are also possible. The treatment plan includes referral to the care team for further evaluation, including a neurological exam and possible imaging studies if not already performed. The patient is advised to report any new symptoms such as weakness, numbness, speech difficulties, or worsening confusion immediately.
