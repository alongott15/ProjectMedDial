## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, open-ended questions about the progression and impact of weakness, explores associated symptoms (headache, nausea, vomiting), and provides reasonable safety advice without introducing unsupported diagnoses or severe interventions. The patient responses are coherent and match the described symptoms. There are no obvious hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and introduces associated symptoms naturally. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any attempts at self-management or express specific concerns or anxieties.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. To further improve, the doctor could briefly ask about any recent injuries, medication changes, or relevant medical history, as these are common in such assessments.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and smooth, with each question building on previous answers. The transition to safety advice and next steps is appropriate. A brief summary or explicit check for understanding at the end could enhance closure.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate for a light case with concerning but not severe symptoms. The recommendation for in-person evaluation is prudent. No clarity issues detected.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it’s nice to see you today. What’s been bothering you or bringing you in for a visit?

**Patient**: I've been having some weakness in my legs that's gotten worse, and it's starting to worry me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this is affecting your everyday activities—are you having trouble walking, standing up from a chair, or doing things around the house?

**Patient**: Yes, it's been harder to walk and stand up from a chair lately. I notice my legs just don't feel as strong as they usually do.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your arms—have you noticed any weakness or changes in strength there, or is it mainly just your legs?

**Patient**: Yes, I've started to notice some weakness in my arms too. It wasn't there at first, but it's been happening more recently.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other changes—have you noticed numbness, tingling, or any unusual sensations in your arms or legs?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling—just the weakness in my legs and now in my arms.

**Doctor**: Alright. When did you first notice these changes, and have they come on gradually or suddenly?

**Patient**: I first noticed the weakness in my legs a few days ago, and it seems like it's been coming on gradually rather than all at once.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any problems with your balance or any recent falls since these changes began?

**Patient**: I haven't had any falls, but my balance does feel off when I try to walk.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about how this is affecting your daily routine—are you able to manage things like climbing stairs, getting dressed, or carrying groceries, or do you find yourself needing help with those tasks?

**Patient**: It's been tough to keep up with my usual routine. Climbing stairs is harder, and I need to take breaks. I've also had a headache and some nausea along with the weakness.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you have the headache and nausea, do they come on at the same time as the weakness, or do they happen separately?

**Patient**: The headache and nausea usually come on around the same time as the weakness. Sometimes I also feel like I might vomit when the headache gets worse.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like these changes are making daily tasks much more challenging for you, and the combination of symptoms is important to pay attention to. Sometimes, when weakness spreads from the legs to the arms and is accompanied by other symptoms, it can be due to a range of causes—from something as simple as a viral illness affecting your body’s energy, to changes in the nervous system or even issues with things like electrolytes or blood pressure.

Because these symptoms are new and getting worse, it’s important to check for anything that might need more urgent attention. Warning signs to watch for would include sudden difficulty speaking, swallowing, seeing, or breathing, or if you lose control of your bladder or bowels. If any of those happen, seek care right away.

For now, I recommend you arrange an in-person evaluation soon so a healthcare provider can examine your strength, check your reflexes, and possibly do some basic tests. In the meantime, try to avoid situations where you might fall, and ask for help with tasks that feel unsafe.

Let me know if you have any questions or if anything changes before your appointment.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I understand what to watch out for, and I’ll make sure to get checked out soon. If anything changes or I notice any of those warning signs, I’ll reach out right away.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 56-year-old woman presenting with a one-day history of leg weakness progressing to arm weakness, accompanied by headache, nausea, and vomiting. She reported taking four aspirin for her headache and had a history of a fall with head injury one month prior. Her past medical history includes hypertension and menopause, and she is taking Prempro, Univasc, and aspirin as needed; she has no known drug allergies. On examination, she had right-sided motor weakness and abnormal pupillary findings. Head CT revealed a subacute and acute subdural hematoma with midline shift and minimal hydrocephalus. The documented diagnosis was subdural hematoma. She underwent left frontal and parietal burr hole evacuation of the hematoma without complications. Postoperatively, her neurological status improved, and she was discharged home on Percocet as needed for headache, with instructions for follow-up and repeat head CT in two weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with progressive weakness in the legs, now involving the arms. The weakness began a few days ago and has gradually worsened, making walking, standing from a chair, climbing stairs, and daily activities more difficult; balance is also impaired, though there have been no falls. The patient denies numbness or tingling but reports associated headache and nausea that occur alongside the weakness, with occasional near-vomiting when the headache intensifies. No specific relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were documented. The clinical impression included possible causes such as viral illness, nervous system changes, or electrolyte/blood pressure issues, but no definitive diagnosis was made. The doctor advised urgent attention if warning signs such as difficulty speaking, swallowing, vision changes, breathing problems, or loss of bladder/bowel control occur. The treatment plan includes arranging an in-person evaluation soon for examination and basic tests, avoiding fall risks, and seeking help with unsafe tasks. The patient was instructed to monitor for any worsening or new symptoms and to seek immediate care if warning signs develop.
