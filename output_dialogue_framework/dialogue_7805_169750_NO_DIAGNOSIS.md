## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.700
- **Justification**: The dialogue is mostly plausible and follows a logical clinical reasoning process for unilateral hearing loss with dizziness and mild nystagmus. However, there is a significant hallucination: the doctor speculates about vestibular neuritis or sudden sensorineural hearing loss as possible causes, but the patient profile explicitly states a history of right acoustic neuroma status post trans-labyrinthine resection. This prior diagnosis should be central to the assessment, and the doctor should acknowledge it rather than suggesting unrelated etiologies. Otherwise, the questions and responses are appropriate for the symptoms described.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and describes symptoms well. It would be helpful if the patient mentioned their surgical history if not prompted, but this is not strictly necessary if the doctor should know it.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor should reference the patient's known history of acoustic neuroma and surgery, as this is highly relevant to the current symptoms. Avoid suggesting alternative diagnoses that are not supported by the profile. Instead, discuss possible post-surgical complications or recurrence.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and covers relevant symptom domains. It would be improved by integrating the patient's medical history earlier in the conversation.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The advice about seeking prompt evaluation and monitoring for red flag symptoms is appropriate. However, clarity would be improved by explicitly connecting current symptoms to the patient's known diagnosis and surgical history.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s good to see you today. What’s been bringing you in—can you tell me in your own words what’s been going on lately?

**Patient**: I’ve been noticing some hearing loss on my right side lately. That’s mainly why I wanted to come in and get it checked out.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed the change—how long has this been going on, and did it come on suddenly or gradually?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it began, but I think it's been a few days now. It seemed to come on pretty suddenly for me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms you might have noticed—have you experienced any dizziness, ringing in your ear, or a feeling of fullness on that side?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve had some dizziness along with the hearing loss. I haven’t really noticed any ringing or a full feeling in my ear, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much is this change in hearing and the dizziness affecting your daily activities—are you having trouble with balance, conversations, or anything else you do regularly?

**Patient**: It’s made conversations a bit harder since I can’t hear as well on that side. I’ve also felt a little unsteady at times because of the dizziness, but I’m still able to get around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about whether you've had any recent colds, sinus issues, or upper respiratory symptoms before this started. Sometimes those can be related to sudden hearing changes.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any colds or sinus problems lately. The only other thing I’ve noticed is some mild nausea along with the dizziness.

**Doctor**: Alright. Since this started, have you noticed any changes in your vision or trouble moving your eyes? Sometimes issues with hearing and balance can also be linked to eye movements, so it’s helpful to know.

**Patient**: I've had some mild nystagmus, but no real changes in my vision otherwise. Moving my eyes hasn't been a problem.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your right ear specifically—have you had any pain, drainage, or history of ear infections on that side? Sometimes local issues in the ear can contribute to sudden changes in hearing.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any pain, drainage, or ear infections on that side.

**Doctor**: Alright. Since this hearing loss started, have you noticed if anything—like certain head positions, loud sounds, or movement—makes your symptoms better or worse? Sometimes triggers can give us clues about the cause.

**Patient**: Nothing really seems to make it better or worse. Moving around might make the dizziness a little more noticeable, but otherwise, I haven't noticed any specific triggers.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your sudden hearing loss on one side along with dizziness and mild nystagmus, but without pain, drainage, or recent illness, suggests this could be an issue with the inner ear—possibly something like vestibular neuritis or sudden sensorineural hearing loss. These conditions can affect both balance and hearing because the inner ear is responsible for both.

It’s a good sign that you’re still able to get around, but I do want to stress that sudden hearing loss—especially with dizziness—should be evaluated promptly. Early intervention can sometimes improve outcomes.

For now, try to avoid sudden movements that could worsen your dizziness, and be cautious with activities that require good balance. If you notice any new symptoms like severe headache, weakness, trouble speaking, or changes in your vision, seek immediate care.

I’d recommend seeing an ear, nose, and throat specialist soon for further evaluation and possibly a hearing test. In the meantime, how much is this hearing change affecting your day-to-day life—are there particular activities you’re struggling with or concerned about?

**Patient**: I appreciate you explaining all that. The hearing loss makes conversations tougher, especially in noisy places. I’m mostly just worried about feeling off balance when I’m out and about, but I’m still able to manage my regular routines for now.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 61-year-old male presenting with long-standing right-sided hearing loss. Evaluation revealed a right-sided 1.6 cm acoustic neuroma, for which he underwent a trans-labyrinthine excision. His past medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, and he takes Cardizem CD, Lipitor, and Hydrochlorothiazide; he has no known drug allergies. Postoperatively, he experienced mild nystagmus, dizziness, and mild nausea, which resolved over several days. Physical therapy was consulted for ambulation support. The documented diagnosis was right-sided acoustic neuroma. He was discharged in stable condition with Percocet prescribed for pain as needed and instructions for outpatient follow-up.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with sudden hearing loss on the right side. Symptoms included hearing loss for a few days with sudden onset, associated dizziness, mild nausea, and mild nystagmus; no ringing, ear fullness, pain, drainage, or history of ear infections were reported. The patient denied recent colds, sinus issues, or upper respiratory symptoms and noted that movement may worsen dizziness but no specific triggers for hearing loss. The hearing loss has made conversations more difficult and caused some unsteadiness, but the patient remains able to manage daily activities. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. On assessment, the doctor noted sudden unilateral hearing loss with dizziness and mild nystagmus, without other neurological symptoms or ear complaints, suggesting possible inner ear involvement such as vestibular neuritis or sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The doctor advised prompt evaluation by an ear, nose, and throat specialist and recommended a hearing test. Additional advice included avoiding sudden movements, being cautious with balance-related activities, and seeking immediate care if new severe symptoms arise.
