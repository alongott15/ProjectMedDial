## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the patient's symptoms, explores possible triggers, and checks for warning signs of complications. The patient responses are coherent and match the described symptoms. The doctor's summary and recommendations are reasonable for a light, common case with concern for post-surgical infection, and there are no unsupported diagnoses or treatments introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce unsupported symptoms. For even greater realism, the patient could specify approximate blood pressure readings or describe the fever in more detail (e.g., how high, how measured), but this is not required.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly address the patient's question about managing leg swelling (e.g., recommend elevating legs or monitoring for worsening), as this was asked at the end but not answered in the provided text.

**Conversation Flow**: The conversation flows logically, with each turn building on the previous one. The dialogue maintains a clear structure: symptom exploration, risk assessment, summary, and safety advice. The only minor gap is the lack of response to the patient's final question.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The doctor provides clear safety-netting advice and appropriately recommends in-person evaluation without making unsupported treatment recommendations. No safety concerns are present.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in. What brings you in today, and how have you been feeling recently?

**Patient**: I've been feeling pretty rough lately—my blood pressure has been higher than usual and I just can't seem to stop throwing up.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your symptoms—when did you first notice your blood pressure was running higher and the vomiting started?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly, but I think it's been a few days now. The vomiting kind of started around the same time I noticed my blood pressure was up.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how things have been changing—has your vomiting or blood pressure been getting better, worse, or staying about the same over these past few days?

**Patient**: Honestly, it feels like both the vomiting and my blood pressure have just stayed about the same—no real improvement.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about possible triggers—have you noticed if anything you eat, drink, or do seems to bring on the vomiting or affect your blood pressure?

**Patient**: Nothing really seems to trigger it—it just happens no matter what I eat or do. I haven't noticed any pattern with my blood pressure either.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much are these symptoms interfering with your daily routine—are you able to eat, sleep, and go about your normal activities, or is it making things difficult?

**Patient**: It's honestly making things pretty tough—I can't keep food down at all, and sleeping has been hard because I feel sick and have a fever. Going about my normal day just isn't happening right now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your blood pressure—do you have a way to check it at home, and if so, what kind of numbers have you been seeing?

**Patient**: Yes, I have a blood pressure monitor at home. The numbers have been higher than usual, but I don't remember the exact readings right now.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fever, like headaches, changes in vision, or swelling in your hands or feet?

**Patient**: Yeah, I've had some swelling in my lower legs and feet. I also noticed the area around my abdominal incision is more red and kind of firm. No headaches or changes in vision though.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you mentioned redness and firmness near your abdominal incision, have you noticed any drainage or unusual odor from that area?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any drainage or strange smell from the incision—just the redness and that it's kind of hard and swollen.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you're dealing with several issues at once: persistent vomiting, fever, swelling in your legs and feet, and some redness and firmness near your abdominal incision. These symptoms together can sometimes point to an infection or inflammation, especially given the changes around your incision. The ongoing high blood pressure and swelling could also be related to your body's response to illness or possibly fluid retention.

I'm asking about these details because it's important to check for warning signs of complications after any surgery or procedure, especially if there's fever and swelling. While you haven't noticed drainage or odor, the redness and firmness are still concerning.

For now, keep an eye out for worsening redness, new drainage, severe pain, or if you start feeling confused or very weak—those would be reasons to seek care promptly. Staying hydrated is important, but if you can't keep fluids down at all, that also needs medical attention.

Given your symptoms and the incision changes, I recommend you contact your healthcare provider soon for an in-person evaluation. They may want to check the incision and run some basic tests. Most post-surgical infections are treatable, but catching them early is best.

Let me know if you have questions about what to expect or what to watch for.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I’ll definitely keep an eye out for any new drainage or if things get worse. Is there anything I should do for the swelling in my legs while I wait to be seen?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 28-year-old female presenting with elevated blood pressures, intractable nausea and vomiting, low-grade fever, and increased erythema around her abdominal incision following a recent low transverse cesarean section. She reported no unusual vaginal discharge, minimal vaginal bleeding, and denied dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, right upper quadrant pain, or visual changes. Her medical history includes class C diabetes (with prior diabetic ketoacidosis) and recent cesarean section for arrest of descent; she has no known drug allergies and was on NPH and Humalog insulin prior to admission. On admission, laboratory findings included leukocytosis (WBC 22), hyperglycemia (fingerstick 219–320), proteinuria (590 mg/24h), and a small right pleural effusion on chest x-ray. The documented diagnoses were diabetic ketoacidosis, postpartum endomyometritis, and preeclampsia. Treatment included intravenous fluids, insulin drip transitioned to subcutaneous insulin, electrolyte replacement, magnesium therapy for preeclampsia, antihypertensives (labetalol and nifedipine), and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, clindamycin) later transitioned to oral Augmentin; a percutaneous drain was placed for a possible abscess. The patient was discharged in stable condition after defervescence and normalization of laboratory values, with instructions for close outpatient follow-up after signing out against medical advice.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with concerns of elevated blood pressure and persistent vomiting. Symptoms began a few days ago and include ongoing vomiting unresponsive to dietary changes, high blood pressure (exact readings not recalled), fever, inability to keep food down, difficulty sleeping, and swelling in the lower legs and feet. The patient also reports redness, firmness, and swelling around a recent abdominal incision, but denies drainage or odor from the site; no headaches or visual changes are present. Relevant history includes recent abdominal surgery (implied by the presence of an incision). The clinical impression is possible post-surgical infection or inflammation, with concern for fluid retention contributing to swelling and elevated blood pressure. The physician advised close monitoring for worsening redness, new drainage, severe pain, confusion, or increased weakness, and emphasized the importance of staying hydrated. The patient was instructed to contact their healthcare provider soon for in-person evaluation and possible further testing.
