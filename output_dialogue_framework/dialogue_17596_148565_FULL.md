## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the patient's symptoms, explores possible triggers, and checks for warning signs of complications. The patient responses are coherent and match the described symptoms. The doctor's summary and recommendations are reasonable for a light, common case with concern for post-surgical infection, and there are no unsupported diagnoses or treatments introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce unsupported symptoms. For even greater realism, the patient could specify approximate blood pressure readings or describe the fever in more detail (e.g., how high, how measured), but this is not required.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly address the patient's question about managing leg swelling (e.g., recommend elevating legs or monitoring for worsening), as this was asked at the end but not answered in the provided text.

**Conversation Flow**: The conversation flows logically, with each turn building on the previous one. The dialogue maintains a clear structure: symptom exploration, risk assessment, summary, and safety advice. The only minor gap is the lack of response to the patient's final question.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The doctor provides clear safety-netting advice and appropriately recommends in-person evaluation without making unsupported treatment recommendations. No safety concerns are present.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in. What brings you in today, and how have you been feeling recently?

**Patient**: I've been feeling pretty rough lately—my blood pressure has been higher than usual and I just can't seem to stop throwing up.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your symptoms—when did you first notice your blood pressure was running higher and the vomiting started?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly, but I think it's been a few days now. The vomiting kind of started around the same time I noticed my blood pressure was up.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how things have been changing—has your vomiting or blood pressure been getting better, worse, or staying about the same over these past few days?

**Patient**: Honestly, it feels like both the vomiting and my blood pressure have just stayed about the same—no real improvement.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about possible triggers—have you noticed if anything you eat, drink, or do seems to bring on the vomiting or affect your blood pressure?

**Patient**: Nothing really seems to trigger it—it just happens no matter what I eat or do. I haven't noticed any pattern with my blood pressure either.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much are these symptoms interfering with your daily routine—are you able to eat, sleep, and go about your normal activities, or is it making things difficult?

**Patient**: It's honestly making things pretty tough—I can't keep food down at all, and sleeping has been hard because I feel sick and have a fever. Going about my normal day just isn't happening right now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your blood pressure—do you have a way to check it at home, and if so, what kind of numbers have you been seeing?

**Patient**: Yes, I have a blood pressure monitor at home. The numbers have been higher than usual, but I don't remember the exact readings right now.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fever, like headaches, changes in vision, or swelling in your hands or feet?

**Patient**: Yeah, I've had some swelling in my lower legs and feet. I also noticed the area around my abdominal incision is more red and kind of firm. No headaches or changes in vision though.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you mentioned redness and firmness near your abdominal incision, have you noticed any drainage or unusual odor from that area?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any drainage or strange smell from the incision—just the redness and that it's kind of hard and swollen.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you're dealing with several issues at once: persistent vomiting, fever, swelling in your legs and feet, and some redness and firmness near your abdominal incision. These symptoms together can sometimes point to an infection or inflammation, especially given the changes around your incision. The ongoing high blood pressure and swelling could also be related to your body's response to illness or possibly fluid retention.

I'm asking about these details because it's important to check for warning signs of complications after any surgery or procedure, especially if there's fever and swelling. While you haven't noticed drainage or odor, the redness and firmness are still concerning.

For now, keep an eye out for worsening redness, new drainage, severe pain, or if you start feeling confused or very weak—those would be reasons to seek care promptly. Staying hydrated is important, but if you can't keep fluids down at all, that also needs medical attention.

Given your symptoms and the incision changes, I recommend you contact your healthcare provider soon for an in-person evaluation. They may want to check the incision and run some basic tests. Most post-surgical infections are treatable, but catching them early is best.

Let me know if you have questions about what to expect or what to watch for.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I’ll definitely keep an eye out for any new drainage or if things get worse. Is there anything I should do for the swelling in my legs while I wait to be seen?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 28-year-old female presenting with elevated blood pressures, intractable nausea and vomiting, low-grade fever (to 100.4°F), and increased erythema around her abdominal incision ten days after a low transverse cesarean section. She denied unusual vaginal discharge, significant vaginal bleeding, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches, right upper quadrant pain, or visual changes. Her past medical history is notable for class C diabetes (diagnosed 12 years ago) and one prior episode of diabetic ketoacidosis; she has no known drug allergies and was taking NPH insulin and sliding-scale Humalog prior to admission. On evaluation at the outside hospital, she had urine ketones and an elevated white blood cell count. The clinical impression included possible cellulitis at the incision site and concerns for infection and poor glycemic control. Treatment included intravenous fluids, subcutaneous insulin, and initiation of Kefzol (cefazolin) for suspected cellulitis. She was transferred for further evaluation and management.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with concerns of elevated blood pressure and persistent vomiting. Symptoms included several days of ongoing vomiting (not triggered by food or activity), inability to keep food down, difficulty sleeping, fever, and swelling in the lower legs and feet. The patient also reported redness, firmness, and swelling around a recent abdominal incision, but denied any drainage or unusual odor from the site; no headaches or changes in vision were noted. The patient has been monitoring blood pressure at home but could not recall specific readings. The doctor assessed that the combination of persistent vomiting, fever, leg and foot swelling, and incision changes could indicate infection or inflammation, possibly related to recent surgery, and noted that high blood pressure and swelling might be due to illness or fluid retention. The doctor advised the patient to monitor for worsening redness, new drainage, severe pain, confusion, or inability to keep fluids down, and to seek prompt care if these occurred. The patient was specifically recommended to contact their healthcare provider soon for an in-person evaluation of the incision and possible further testing.
