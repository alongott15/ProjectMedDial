## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the onset, nature, and associated symptoms of the discomfort, as well as about the episode of confusion postoperatively. The reasoning about possible causes (muscle strain, joint irritation, dental/sinus issues) is plausible for mild, steady discomfort in a patient with relevant cardiac history but no acute warning signs. The advice given is conservative and safe, with clear instructions on when to seek urgent care. No unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments are introduced, and the conversation remains focused and coherent.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could provide slightly more detail about the character of discomfort (sharp/dull, constant/intermittent) or any self-care tried so far.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's reasoning is thorough and explanations are clear. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's cardiac history when discussing why certain symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath) would be concerning, to reinforce safety.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between topics. For improvement, consider summarizing key points at the end before closing to reinforce understanding.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety is well addressed with clear red flags provided. Clarity is high; however, a brief recap of the plan at the end could further ensure patient understanding.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me what’s been going on lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some discomfort in my shoulder and jaw. It's been bothering me and I thought I should get it checked out.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discomfort—when did you first notice these symptoms, and have they come on gradually or suddenly?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it started, but I noticed the shoulder and jaw discomfort a few days ago. It seemed to come on gradually rather than all at once.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed things like shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling unusually tired along with this discomfort?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any shortness of breath or sweating. I did have some confusion and trouble remembering who I was a few days after my surgery, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you experienced that confusion after your surgery, how long did it last, and have you felt fully back to your usual self since then?

**Patient**: The confusion lasted for a little while, maybe just that day. I feel more like myself now, but I did have a change in my mental status around that time.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you had that episode of confusion, was anyone with you who noticed anything unusual, like slurred speech or weakness? Or did you experience any headaches or vision changes at the same time?

**Patient**: No one mentioned anything like slurred speech or weakness, and I didn't have headaches or vision changes at that time. It was mainly just the confusion and change in my mental status.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your recovery since then—have you had any more episodes where you felt confused or not quite yourself, or has it only happened that one time after your surgery?

**Patient**: No, that confusion only happened the one time after my surgery. I haven’t had any more episodes like that since.

**Doctor**: Alright. Since the discomfort in your shoulder and jaw started a few days ago, have you noticed if anything makes it better or worse—like movement, eating, or resting?

**Patient**: I haven't really noticed anything that makes it better or worse. It just kind of stays the same, no matter what I'm doing.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since your confusion happened after surgery and hasn’t come back, it may have been related to the recovery process or medications. As for your current discomfort, on a scale from 1 to 10, how bothersome is it right now? This helps me understand how much it’s affecting you day-to-day.

**Patient**: Right now, I'd rate the discomfort around a 5 out of 10. It's enough to notice, but not stopping me from doing things.

**Doctor**: From what you’ve told me, it sounds like your episode of confusion happened just once after your surgery and resolved the same day, which can sometimes occur as people recover from anesthesia or certain medications. Since you haven’t had any more episodes and you’re feeling back to normal, that’s reassuring.

Regarding your current discomfort in the shoulder and jaw, since it’s been steady and hasn’t changed with activity or rest, I’m considering common causes like muscle strain, joint irritation, or sometimes even dental or sinus issues. These areas can sometimes refer pain to each other, so it’s not unusual for jaw and shoulder discomfort to be linked.

What’s important is that you haven’t had chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms. However, if you notice any new symptoms such as chest pain, severe shortness of breath, sweating, or if the discomfort suddenly worsens, those would be reasons to seek care right away.

For now, gentle stretching, avoiding activities that aggravate the area, and using over-the-counter pain relievers if needed can help. If the discomfort persists beyond a couple of weeks or gets worse, we should take a closer look to rule out less common causes.

Does that explanation make sense? And is there anything else about your recovery or these symptoms that you’re worried about?

**Patient**: Yes, that explanation makes sense to me. I appreciate you talking me through it. I’ll keep an eye on things and let you know if anything changes, but for now I feel a bit better about what’s going on.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, it sounds like your episode of confusion was likely related to your recent surgery and recovery, especially since it was brief and hasn’t returned. It’s not uncommon for people to experience temporary changes in mental status after anesthesia or certain medications, and the fact that you’ve felt back to normal since is reassuring.

As for the ongoing discomfort, since it’s steady but not severe and isn’t limiting your activities, it may be due to something minor like muscle tension or referred discomfort, which can happen after surgery or with changes in routine.

The key things to watch for would be any new symptoms—like chest pain, sudden shortness of breath, or worsening confusion—as these could indicate something more urgent. Otherwise, gentle movement and over-the-counter pain relief are reasonable steps.

If the discomfort continues beyond a couple of weeks or becomes more bothersome, let’s plan to check in again. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out if anything feels different or concerning. How does that plan sound to you?

**Patient**: That plan sounds good to me. I feel better knowing what to watch out for, and I’ll reach out if anything changes. Thanks for explaining everything so clearly.

**Doctor**: Let me share my thoughts after hearing your story. Given that your confusion happened just once after surgery and resolved quickly, it’s likely related to the effects of anesthesia or medications—this is a common and usually temporary part of recovery for some people. As for your current discomfort, since it’s steady, not severe, and hasn’t been accompanied by more concerning symptoms, it points toward something like muscle tension or mild joint irritation, which can happen after periods of rest or changes in activity.

The most important thing is that you’re not experiencing any warning signs such as chest pain, sudden shortness of breath, or new confusion. If any of those develop, it would be important to seek care promptly. For now, gentle movement, staying active within your comfort zone, and using over-the-counter pain relief if needed are good first steps. Let’s keep an eye on things, and if the discomfort persists or changes, we’ll look into it further together.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I feel reassured, and I’ll keep an eye on my symptoms like you said. If anything changes, I’ll let you know.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 64-year-old male presenting with exertional and non-exertional shoulder and jaw discomfort. His symptoms included episodes of pain, with one notable episode occurring the week prior to admission; exercise testing revealed ST depression and a myocardial perfusion defect. Relevant history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, left carotid stenosis, peptic ulcer disease, tobacco use, and a family history of coronary artery disease. Cardiac catheterization showed significant multi-vessel coronary artery disease, including 100% stenosis of the right coronary artery. The documented diagnosis was status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x4. Treatment included CABG with four grafts, postoperative monitoring, management of transient confusion with Valium and supportive care, and discharge on medications such as Lopressor, Lasix, KCL, aspirin, ibuprofen, Percocet, and Klonopin as needed. The patient was stable at discharge and instructed to follow up with his cardiac surgeon and primary care physician in two weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with discomfort in the shoulder and jaw as the chief complaint. The discomfort began gradually a few days prior to the visit, is rated 5 out of 10 in severity, and does not change with activity, rest, or eating. The patient denied associated symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, or recurrent confusion. There is a relevant history of a single episode of confusion and altered mental status occurring shortly after recent surgery, which resolved the same day and has not recurred. The clinical impression was that the transient confusion was likely related to anesthesia or medications during surgical recovery, and the current discomfort is most consistent with muscle tension, mild joint irritation, or referred pain. No acute or urgent findings were identified. The treatment plan included reassurance, gentle stretching and movement, use of over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. The patient was advised to follow up if symptoms persist beyond a couple of weeks or if concerning symptoms develop.
