## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, open-ended questions about the patient's confusion, agitation, and recovery after surgery, and the patient provides plausible, relevant answers. The clinical reasoning is sound, focusing on postoperative delirium and medication withdrawal, and the advice is appropriate for a light case. There are no hallucinations or unsupported content. The conversation is clear, empathetic, and avoids introducing new diagnoses or severe complications.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For even greater realism, occasional uncertainty or more specific examples of daily challenges could be included.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor is thorough and empathetic. To further enhance realism, could briefly mention monitoring for infection or other common post-op issues, but this is not required.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between topics. The conversation could be slightly shorter by consolidating some reassurance statements, but overall it is well-paced.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The advice is appropriate for the scenario and reinforces when to seek further care.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s good to see you today. What’s been bothering you the most recently?

**Patient**: I guess what’s been bothering me most is some confusion and feeling a bit agitated, especially after my surgery. It’s been hard to think clearly at times.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—did these changes in your thinking and mood begin right after your surgery, or did they develop a bit later?

**Patient**: It started after the surgery, but I’m not exactly sure how soon. I remember feeling more confused and agitated when they tried to lower my Ativan.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how things have been lately—has your confusion or agitation been getting better, worse, or staying about the same since the surgery?

**Patient**: It’s actually been improving. My mental status cleared up around the ninth day after surgery, and I’ve felt more like myself since then.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you were feeling more confused and agitated, did you notice if anything specific seemed to bring it on or make it worse—like being in a noisy environment, changes in your routine, or certain times of day?

**Patient**: No, I didn’t notice anything in particular making it worse. It mostly seemed to happen when they tried to reduce the Ativan. Other than that, I’m not sure if anything else brought it on.

**Doctor**: Alright. Since your mental clarity has improved, are you currently having any trouble with memory, focusing, or feeling anxious during your usual daily activities?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any trouble with memory or focusing lately. I do still get a bit anxious sometimes, but it’s not as bad as before.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you were experiencing those episodes, did they interfere with things like having conversations, following instructions, or taking care of yourself day-to-day?

**Patient**: Yes, during those episodes, I did have trouble following instructions and having conversations. Taking care of myself was harder too, but that’s gotten better since my mental status improved.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your sleep—during the time you were feeling more confused and agitated, did you have trouble sleeping or changes in your usual sleep patterns? Sometimes sleep disruption can contribute to those kinds of symptoms.

**Patient**: I did have trouble sleeping during that time. My heart was racing and I had a fever, which made it hard to rest properly.

**Doctor**: I see. Since your symptoms have improved and you’re feeling more like yourself, it’s common for people to experience temporary confusion and agitation after surgery, especially when medications like Ativan are adjusted. Sleep disruption, fever, and a racing heart can all contribute as well. 

If you notice these symptoms returning or if you develop new issues like persistent confusion, severe anxiety, or trouble caring for yourself again, please let your healthcare team know right away. For now, focusing on good sleep habits and staying hydrated can help with ongoing recovery. Does that all make sense, or is there anything else about your recovery you’d like to discuss?

**Patient**: Yes, that all makes sense to me. I appreciate you explaining how the Ativan changes and the sleep issues fit in. Right now I’m just glad my mental status cleared up around the ninth day after surgery. If anything comes up again, I’ll let you know.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, it sounds like your confusion and agitation were most noticeable after your surgery and seemed to be linked with changes in your medication and difficulty sleeping. This kind of reaction is actually quite common in older adults after surgery—especially when sedative medications are adjusted or stopped, and when sleep is disrupted by things like fever or a racing heart. The good news is that your symptoms improved as your body recovered and your routine stabilized.

Right now, since you’re feeling clear-headed and back to your usual self, I don’t think there’s cause for concern. If you ever notice these symptoms returning, or if you have trouble sleeping or feel unusually anxious again, it’s important to let your healthcare team know promptly. In the meantime, focusing on regular sleep, gentle activity, and staying hydrated will support your recovery.

Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns about your recovery or anything else on your mind.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining everything so clearly. I feel relieved that this is a common reaction and that things have improved. Right now, I don’t have any other concerns, but I’ll keep an eye out for any changes.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your episodes of confusion and agitation were likely related to the recovery process after surgery and adjustments in your medication. This is a common scenario, especially in older adults, as the body and brain can be sensitive to both surgery and changes in sedatives like Ativan. The fact that your mental clarity returned and you’re back to your usual routine is very reassuring.

What often happens in these situations is that the combination of anesthesia, medication changes, and disrupted sleep can temporarily affect thinking and mood. The good news is that these symptoms typically resolve as you recover, which matches your experience.

Going forward, continue to monitor for any return of confusion or difficulty with daily activities. If you ever notice these symptoms coming back, or if you have new concerns, please reach out promptly. Otherwise, maintaining good sleep habits and staying active will support your ongoing recovery. If there’s anything else on your mind, feel free to bring it up.

**Patient**: That all sounds clear to me. I’m glad to hear this is common and usually gets better. If anything changes or I start feeling confused again, I’ll reach out like you said. Thanks for your help.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted for surgical management following an incomplete surveillance colonoscopy due to a large adenoma at the hepatic flexure. He underwent an extended right colectomy, initially laparoscopic but converted to open, and initially did well postoperatively with morphine PCA for pain control. On postoperative day two, he developed agitation and florid delirium tremens, with tachycardia and ST depressions on EKG, attributed to alcohol withdrawal; he was treated with Ativan drip, folate, thiamine, multivitamin, and later transitioned to Valium. During his ICU stay, he developed aspiration pneumonia with sputum cultures positive for E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, for which Levofloxacin was started. Relevant history includes diabetes mellitus, prior prostatectomy, artificial urinary sphincter, agoraphobia, osteoarthritis, alcohol use, and a sulfa allergy; home medication was Celexa. The patient’s Foley catheter and artificial urinary sphincter were discontinued by Urology during admission. He was discharged in stable condition on a ten-day course of Levofloxacin, with instructions to follow up in 2–3 weeks, resume a regular diet, and continue home medications.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with confusion and agitation as the main complaint, which began after a recent surgery. Symptoms included difficulty thinking clearly, trouble following instructions, impaired self-care, sleep disruption, fever, and a racing heart; these symptoms were most pronounced when Ativan was reduced postoperatively. The patient reports that mental status improved around the ninth day after surgery, with current resolution of confusion and only mild residual anxiety. No specific triggers for the episodes were identified aside from medication adjustment and sleep disturbance. Relevant history includes recent surgery and use of Ativan, with no mention of other medical conditions or allergies. The clinical impression was postoperative delirium or acute confusional state likely related to surgery, sedative adjustment, and sleep disruption. The treatment plan emphasized monitoring for recurrence of symptoms, maintaining good sleep hygiene, staying hydrated, gentle activity, and prompt communication with the healthcare team if symptoms return. No new medications or interventions were initiated at this visit.
