## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks relevant, plausible questions about the hearing loss, dizziness, and associated symptoms, and provides reasonable advice for a mild case. The patient responses are coherent and match the symptoms listed in the profile. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events introduced. The conversation is clear, respectful, and follows a logical flow.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient could mention all symptoms upfront (including mild nausea), but the gradual disclosure is realistic and common in real encounters.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor could explicitly acknowledge the patient's history of acoustic neuroma and surgery, as this is relevant to the current symptoms and would demonstrate thoroughness.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is smooth and natural, with appropriate follow-up questions and summary. A brief recap of the patient's surgical history would further ground the conversation.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate for a mild case. Clarity could be improved by referencing the patient's known diagnosis (acoustic neuroma status post resection) when discussing possible causes.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me what's been going on and how it's affecting your daily routine?

**Patient**: I've noticed some hearing loss on my right side recently. It’s made things a bit harder, especially when I’m trying to follow conversations.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed the change—was it sudden or did it come on gradually over time?

**Patient**: I’m not exactly sure when it started, but I think the hearing loss came on pretty gradually over the last few days.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other changes you've noticed—have you experienced any ringing in your ear, a feeling of fullness, or any pain on that side?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any pain or ringing in my ear. I do get a bit dizzy at times, though.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you feel dizzy, does it tend to happen at certain times—like when you stand up quickly, turn your head, or move in a particular way?

**Patient**: The dizziness seems to get a bit worse when I move my head or turn quickly. It doesn’t always happen, but that’s when I notice it most.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any recent illnesses or congestion—have you had a cold, allergies, or any sinus issues lately? Sometimes those can affect hearing.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any colds or sinus issues lately. My allergies haven’t been acting up either.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since this has been going on for a few days, have you noticed if your hearing on that side is getting worse, staying the same, or starting to improve at all?

**Patient**: My hearing on that side has pretty much stayed the same since I first noticed it. I haven’t noticed any improvement yet.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your balance—have you had any trouble walking straight, or have you experienced any falls or near-falls since this started?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any trouble walking straight, and I haven’t fallen or almost fallen since this started.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about ear pressure or popping sensations—do you notice any changes when you swallow, yawn, or change altitude, like going up in an elevator? Sometimes these clues help us figure out if the middle ear is involved.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any pressure or popping when I swallow or yawn, and going up in an elevator doesn’t seem to make a difference.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you have a gradual onset of hearing loss on one side, with occasional dizziness that’s more noticeable when you move your head, but no pain, ringing, or recent congestion. This pattern can sometimes be related to issues within the inner ear, such as a problem with the balance or hearing nerve, or sometimes even a buildup of fluid behind the eardrum, though you haven’t noticed pressure or popping.

Because your symptoms have lasted several days without improvement and are affecting your ability to follow conversations, it’s worth having your ear checked more closely. While many causes are benign—like wax buildup or age-related changes—sometimes sudden or one-sided hearing loss can be due to treatable conditions that benefit from early attention.

Next steps I’d recommend: avoid inserting anything into your ear, monitor for any new symptoms like severe dizziness, nausea, weakness, or facial drooping, and consider seeing an ear specialist (ENT) for a hearing test and examination. If your dizziness worsens or you notice new symptoms, let a healthcare provider know promptly.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything else about your symptoms you’re concerned about.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining everything. I do get some mild nausea along with the dizziness, but nothing too bad. I’ll follow your advice and look into seeing an ENT. Is there anything specific I should watch for until then?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 61-year-old male presenting with long-standing right-sided hearing loss. Evaluation revealed a right-sided 1.6 cm acoustic neuroma, and he subsequently underwent an uncomplicated right trans-labyrinthine excision of the tumor. Postoperatively, he experienced mild nystagmus, dizziness, and mild nausea, which improved over several days. His past medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, and he takes Cardizem CD, Lipitor, and Hydrochlorothiazide; he has no known drug allergies. The documented diagnosis was right acoustic neuroma status post trans-labyrinthine resection. Treatment included surgical excision of the tumor, postoperative monitoring, physical therapy for ambulation, and discharge medications including Percocet for pain and Colace for bowel management. At discharge, the patient was stable, afebrile, tolerating oral intake, and free of dizziness, with instructions for outpatient follow-up.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with gradual onset right-sided hearing loss as the chief complaint. The hearing loss developed over several days and has remained stable, making it difficult to follow conversations. Associated symptoms include occasional dizziness, which worsens with head movement, and mild nausea; there is no ear pain, tinnitus, aural fullness, pressure, or recent upper respiratory symptoms. The patient denies balance difficulties, falls, or changes with swallowing or altitude. Relevant history of allergies is noted but not currently active; no recent illnesses are reported. The clinical impression is possible inner ear involvement, such as an issue with the balance or hearing nerve, though other causes like wax buildup or age-related changes are also considered. The doctor recommends avoiding inserting objects into the ear, monitoring for new or worsening symptoms (such as severe dizziness, nausea, weakness, or facial drooping), and arranging evaluation by an ENT specialist for further assessment and hearing testing. The patient is advised to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms worsen.
