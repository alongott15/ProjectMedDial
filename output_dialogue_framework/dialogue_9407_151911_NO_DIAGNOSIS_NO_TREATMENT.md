## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC

- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks relevant questions about the shoulder pain, fever, swelling, and mass over the sternum, all of which are supported by the profile.

No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced. The conversation is clear and maintains appropriate roles.

### Feedback for Improvement

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hi, welcome in today. What brings you to see me—how have you been feeling recently?

**Patient**: I've been having some pain in my shoulder, and it's been bothering me quite a bit lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what seems to trigger the discomfort—do you notice if certain movements or activities make your shoulder pain worse or better?

**Patient**: Moving my arm definitely makes it hurt more. I haven’t noticed anything that really helps so far.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first notice the shoulder pain, and has it changed at all since it began?

**Patient**: I first noticed the pain a few days ago. It’s gotten a bit worse since then, especially when I try to move my arm.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth around your shoulder, or any fever since this started? Sometimes those signs can point to inflammation or infection.

**Patient**: Yes, I've had some fever along with the shoulder pain. The area also seems a bit swollen, and I was told there’s an infection in my shoulder.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the swelling—does it feel firm or soft, and have you noticed any changes in its size over the past few days? Also, has your fever been persistent or does it come and go?

**Patient**: The swelling feels pretty firm. I haven't really noticed much change in the size. My fever seems to come and go—it’s not there all the time.

**Doctor**: Alright. In terms of your daily routine, how much is this shoulder issue affecting things like dressing, reaching, or sleeping? Are you able to do most of your usual activities?

**Patient**: It's definitely making things harder. Reaching for things and getting dressed are more difficult, and sleeping has been tough because of the pain.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something related—have you noticed any changes or discomfort around your sternum, like a lump or swelling, or is it just the shoulder that's bothering you right now?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve noticed a mass over my sternum too. It feels uncomfortable, kind of like a lump in that area.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about that lump—have you noticed any changes in the skin over your sternum, like redness or warmth? And does the discomfort there feel similar to what you’re experiencing in your shoulder, or is it different in some way?

**Patient**: Yes, the skin over my sternum feels a bit warm, but I haven’t noticed much redness. The discomfort there is similar to my shoulder pain, just not quite as intense.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re dealing with both a shoulder infection and a mass over your sternum that’s causing discomfort and some warmth in the area. When infections affect joints or nearby tissues, they can lead to swelling, pain with movement, and sometimes fever, as you’ve described. The lump over your sternum could be related to inflammation or infection spreading, especially since it feels warm and uncomfortable.

I’m considering that these symptoms may be connected, possibly indicating an infection that’s affecting more than one area. It’s important to keep an eye out for signs like increasing redness, worsening pain, or difficulty breathing, which can sometimes signal that the infection is getting worse.

For now, managing pain and keeping the affected areas clean and protected is helpful. If you haven’t already, you should be in touch with your healthcare team about antibiotics or other treatments. Make sure to rest as much as possible and avoid putting strain on your shoulder. If you notice any new symptoms—like severe chest pain, high fever that doesn’t go away, or feeling very unwell—seek medical attention promptly.

Let me know if there’s anything specific you’re worried about or if you’d like advice on managing daily activities while you recover.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll keep an eye out for any changes and let my healthcare team know if things get worse. If you have any tips for sleeping more comfortably with this shoulder pain, I’d appreciate it.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 61-year-old male presenting with T7-T8 osteomyelitis. He reported several months of shoulder pain, fever, a shoulder infection, and a mass over the sternum, with persistent pain despite two incision and drainage procedures. MRI revealed increased T2 signal at T7 and T8 consistent with osteomyelitis, and a small bulging disk at T7-T8 without neural impingement. His past medical history includes hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, pancreatitis, depression, and recent cessation of alcohol abuse; he has no known drug allergies. The documented diagnosis was T7-T8 osteomyelitis. Treatment included anterior and posterior spinal fusion surgeries, IV vancomycin for 6 weeks for osteomyelitis, levofloxacin for 10 days for urinary tract infection, pain management, and physical/occupational therapy. He was discharged in good condition to acute rehab with instructions for activity as tolerated, use of a CTLSO brace when out of bed, and close outpatient follow-up.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with shoulder pain as the chief complaint. The pain began a few days ago, has worsened with arm movement, and is accompanied by swelling, intermittent fever, and functional limitations such as difficulty dressing, reaching, and sleeping. The patient also reports a firm, uncomfortable mass over the sternum with associated warmth but minimal redness; the discomfort is similar to the shoulder pain but less intense. There is a history of being told there is an infection in the shoulder. The clinical impression is a shoulder infection with possible extension or related inflammation/infection over the sternum. The treatment plan includes managing pain, keeping affected areas clean and protected, resting, and avoiding strain on the shoulder. The patient is advised to monitor for worsening symptoms (such as increased redness, severe pain, or persistent high fever) and to contact their healthcare team regarding antibiotics or if symptoms progress.
