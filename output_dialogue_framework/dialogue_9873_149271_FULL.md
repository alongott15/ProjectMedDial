## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile and the case type. The doctor asks logical, relevant questions about the pain, drainage, and associated symptoms, and provides clear, appropriate explanations and advice for a mild case of hidradenitis suppurativa with secondary infection. The patient responses are plausible and match the described symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events introduced. The conversation is coherent and maintains appropriate roles.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient provides clear, relevant answers and asks a reasonable follow-up question about nausea. For improvement, the patient could mention any prior similar episodes or current medications if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's HIV and diabetes status as factors that may affect healing or infection risk, without introducing new management steps.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, moving from symptom exploration to explanation and advice. For improvement, a brief summary of next steps (e.g., when to seek urgent care) could be added at the end.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The advice is clear and appropriate for a light case. The doctor could clarify what constitutes 'prompt medical care' (e.g., urgent care vs. ER) for worsening symptoms.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain—when did you first notice it, and has it changed since the cyst burst?

**Patient**: I noticed the pain before the cyst burst, but it definitely got worse after that happened. It's been pretty uncomfortable since then.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about anything that helps or worsens the discomfort—have you noticed if certain activities, movements, or positions make it better or more painful?

**Patient**: Moving my arm seems to make it more painful. I haven't really found a position that helps much yet.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since the cyst burst, have you noticed any redness, warmth, or swelling in the area? These signs can help me understand if there’s ongoing irritation or possible infection.

**Patient**: Yes, there's definitely swelling and the area feels warm. It's also pretty red around where the drainage has been.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any fever or chills since this started? Sometimes, those symptoms can suggest the body is reacting more strongly, which helps me assess the situation.

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any fever or chills with this. The main thing has been the pain and the drainage from the area.

**Doctor**: Got it. Has the drainage changed in appearance—such as becoming thicker, having a foul smell, or changing color? This can help determine if there’s any sign of infection.

**Patient**: Yes, the drainage has been brownish and it smells pretty bad. It also seems thicker than before.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the location—are you able to pinpoint exactly where the pain is, or does it spread to nearby areas like your arm or chest? This helps me understand if the irritation is staying localized or affecting surrounding tissues.

**Patient**: The pain is mostly right in my armpit where the cyst is. It hasn’t really spread to my arm or chest.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall energy—have you felt more tired or run down than usual since this started? Sometimes infections can make you feel generally unwell even without a fever.

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve definitely felt more tired than usual since this started. It’s made it harder to go about my normal routine.

**Doctor**: Okay. How would you rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine? This helps me gauge how much it's impacting you and guides what kind of relief might be most helpful.

**Patient**: Right now, I’d rate the pain around a 7 out of 10. It’s definitely making things uncomfortable for me.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like the area where the cyst burst has become more swollen, red, warm, and is now draining thicker, foul-smelling fluid. These are signs that suggest the area might be developing an infection, even though you haven’t had a fever or chills. The increased fatigue you’re experiencing can also be a subtle sign your body is working to fight something off.

What often happens after a cyst bursts is that bacteria can enter the broken skin, leading to a local infection called an abscess. Because of the changes in drainage and the way the skin looks and feels, it’s important to have this checked in person soon. Treatment often involves cleaning the area and sometimes antibiotics to help clear up the infection.

In the meantime, keeping the area clean and dry is helpful. Avoid squeezing or pressing on it, and wash your hands before and after touching the area. If you notice spreading redness, increasing swelling, or if you develop a fever, those are warning signs to seek prompt medical care.

Let me know if you have questions about what to expect or how to care for the area until you can be seen.

**Patient**: Thanks, that helps me understand what’s going on. I’ll make sure to keep the area clean and watch for any changes. Is it normal to feel a bit nauseous with this? I’ve thrown up twice since the pain got worse.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 43-year-old female presenting with recurrent inflammation and drainage of the right axilla, consistent with hidradenitis suppurativa. She reported a cystic lesion in the right axilla for seven days prior to admission, which burst three days before admission, resulting in increasing pain and brownish, foul-smelling drainage; she also experienced two episodes of nausea and vomiting one day prior to admission. Her relevant history includes HIV, hepatitis C, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, gastritis, and dyslipidemia, with previous similar episodes and surgical interventions for hidradenitis suppurativa. On examination, there was indurated skin with copious purulent drainage in the right axilla, but a full assessment was limited by pain. The documented diagnosis was recurrent hidradenitis suppurativa status post multiple examinations under anesthesia with incision and drainage, and VAC (vacuum-assisted closure) placement. Treatment included multiple surgical debridements and drainages of the right axilla, intravenous antibiotics (Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Vancomycin), pain management with Percocet, continued diabetes management, and placement of a VAC dressing. The patient was discharged in good condition to a rehabilitation facility for ongoing wound care and antibiotics, with follow-up arranged with infectious disease and plastic surgery for possible future reconstruction.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is presenting with pain and drainage from a cyst that recently burst in the armpit. The pain began before the cyst ruptured but worsened afterward, currently rated as 7 out of 10, and is aggravated by arm movement. The area is described as swollen, red, warm, and draining thicker, foul-smelling brownish fluid; the patient also reports increased fatigue and two episodes of vomiting but denies fever or chills. The pain remains localized to the armpit without spreading to the arm or chest. There is no documented relevant medical history, medications, or allergies. The clinical impression is a possible local infection (abscess) developing at the site of the ruptured cyst, based on changes in drainage and skin appearance. The treatment plan includes keeping the area clean and dry, avoiding manipulation, monitoring for worsening symptoms (such as spreading redness, increased swelling, or fever), and seeking in-person evaluation soon; antibiotics may be needed if infection is confirmed. The patient was advised on warning signs and appropriate self-care until further assessment.
