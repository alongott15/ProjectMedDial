## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile and the case type. The doctor asks logical, relevant questions about the pain, drainage, and associated symptoms, and provides clear, appropriate explanations and advice for a mild case of hidradenitis suppurativa with secondary infection. The patient responses are plausible and match the described symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events introduced. The conversation is coherent and maintains appropriate roles.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient provides clear, relevant answers and asks a reasonable follow-up question about nausea. For improvement, the patient could mention any prior similar episodes or current medications if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's HIV and diabetes status as factors that may affect healing or infection risk, without introducing new management steps.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, moving from symptom exploration to explanation and advice. For improvement, a brief summary of next steps (e.g., when to seek urgent care) could be added at the end.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The advice is clear and appropriate for a light case. The doctor could clarify what constitutes 'prompt medical care' (e.g., urgent care vs. ER) for worsening symptoms.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain—when did you first notice it, and has it changed since the cyst burst?

**Patient**: I noticed the pain before the cyst burst, but it definitely got worse after that happened. It's been pretty uncomfortable since then.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about anything that helps or worsens the discomfort—have you noticed if certain activities, movements, or positions make it better or more painful?

**Patient**: Moving my arm seems to make it more painful. I haven't really found a position that helps much yet.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since the cyst burst, have you noticed any redness, warmth, or swelling in the area? These signs can help me understand if there’s ongoing irritation or possible infection.

**Patient**: Yes, there's definitely swelling and the area feels warm. It's also pretty red around where the drainage has been.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any fever or chills since this started? Sometimes, those symptoms can suggest the body is reacting more strongly, which helps me assess the situation.

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any fever or chills with this. The main thing has been the pain and the drainage from the area.

**Doctor**: Got it. Has the drainage changed in appearance—such as becoming thicker, having a foul smell, or changing color? This can help determine if there’s any sign of infection.

**Patient**: Yes, the drainage has been brownish and it smells pretty bad. It also seems thicker than before.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the location—are you able to pinpoint exactly where the pain is, or does it spread to nearby areas like your arm or chest? This helps me understand if the irritation is staying localized or affecting surrounding tissues.

**Patient**: The pain is mostly right in my armpit where the cyst is. It hasn’t really spread to my arm or chest.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall energy—have you felt more tired or run down than usual since this started? Sometimes infections can make you feel generally unwell even without a fever.

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve definitely felt more tired than usual since this started. It’s made it harder to go about my normal routine.

**Doctor**: Okay. How would you rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine? This helps me gauge how much it's impacting you and guides what kind of relief might be most helpful.

**Patient**: Right now, I’d rate the pain around a 7 out of 10. It’s definitely making things uncomfortable for me.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like the area where the cyst burst has become more swollen, red, warm, and is now draining thicker, foul-smelling fluid. These are signs that suggest the area might be developing an infection, even though you haven’t had a fever or chills. The increased fatigue you’re experiencing can also be a subtle sign your body is working to fight something off.

What often happens after a cyst bursts is that bacteria can enter the broken skin, leading to a local infection called an abscess. Because of the changes in drainage and the way the skin looks and feels, it’s important to have this checked in person soon. Treatment often involves cleaning the area and sometimes antibiotics to help clear up the infection.

In the meantime, keeping the area clean and dry is helpful. Avoid squeezing or pressing on it, and wash your hands before and after touching the area. If you notice spreading redness, increasing swelling, or if you develop a fever, those are warning signs to seek prompt medical care.

Let me know if you have questions about what to expect or how to care for the area until you can be seen.

**Patient**: Thanks, that helps me understand what’s going on. I’ll make sure to keep the area clean and watch for any changes. Is it normal to feel a bit nauseous with this? I’ve thrown up twice since the pain got worse.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 43-year-old female presenting with recurrent inflammation and drainage of the right axilla. She reported a cystic lesion in the right axilla for seven days, with increasing pain and a cyst rupture three days prior to admission, followed by brownish, foul-smelling drainage. Associated symptoms included nausea and vomiting (twice, one day before admission), but no fever, chills, sweats, diarrhea, constipation, or urinary symptoms. Her relevant history includes HIV, hepatitis C, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, gastritis, lipidemia, and prior episodes of hidradenitis suppurativa with previous lancing procedures. On physical exam, she was afebrile with slight tachycardia and otherwise stable vital signs. The documented diagnosis is recurrent hidradenitis suppurativa of the right axilla. Treatment included ongoing antiretroviral therapy, diabetes management with insulin, and symptomatic management with Tylenol; specific interventions for the axillary lesion during this admission are not detailed. No drug allergies were reported.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with pain in the armpit associated with a burst cyst. The pain began before the cyst ruptured and worsened afterward, currently rated as 7 out of 10 in severity; movement of the arm increases discomfort, and no position provides relief. The patient reported swelling, warmth, redness around the drainage site, increased fatigue, and drainage that has become thicker, brownish, and foul-smelling; nausea and vomiting (twice) were also mentioned since the pain worsened. No fever or chills were reported, and the pain remains localized to the armpit without spreading to the arm or chest. The doctor noted clinical signs of possible local infection or abscess due to changes in drainage and skin appearance, despite absence of systemic symptoms like fever. The assessment was that the area may be developing an infection following cyst rupture. The doctor recommended keeping the area clean and dry, avoiding squeezing or pressing on it, washing hands before and after touching the area, and seeking prompt medical care if redness spreads, swelling increases, or fever develops; antibiotics may be needed after in-person evaluation.
