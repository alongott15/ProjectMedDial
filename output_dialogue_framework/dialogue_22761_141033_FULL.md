## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile and presents a plausible, focused primary care interaction for postoperative buttock pain following closure of a decubital ulcer. The doctor asks appropriate questions about pain characteristics, surgical history, and signs of infection, and provides reasonable reassurance and advice. The patient responses are coherent and realistic, expressing both symptoms and emotional impact. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders are introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses emotional concerns appropriately. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any self-care measures already tried or ask a follow-up question about expected healing time.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. To further improve, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's agitation and offer simple strategies for coping with discomfort or suggest when to follow up for reassessment.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between history-taking, assessment, and advice. The conversation could be enhanced by inviting the patient to share any other concerns or questions at the end.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns detected. The doctor appropriately discusses red flags for infection and sets expectations for healing.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hi, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me a bit about what's been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some pain in my buttock that's been bothering me. That's the main reason I came in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain—can you describe what it feels like? For example, is it sharp, dull, aching, or something else?

**Patient**: It's more of an aching pain, and it feels pretty uncomfortable, especially since my surgery.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your recent surgery—what type of procedure did you have, and how long ago was it? This can help me understand if your discomfort might be related.

**Patient**: I had surgery to close a sore on my right buttock, I think it was a decubital ulcer. I don’t remember exactly how long ago, but it wasn’t too long back.

**Doctor**: Got it. Can you point to exactly where the discomfort is, or is it more spread out across the area where you had your surgery?

**Patient**: The discomfort is pretty much right where I had the surgery, on my right buttock. It doesn’t really spread out much beyond that spot.

**Doctor**: Alright. How long has this aching pain been present since your surgery, and has it changed at all over time—either getting better or worse?

**Patient**: I’m not exactly sure how many days it’s been, but the pain has been there since after the surgery. It hasn’t really gotten better or worse—it just kind of stays the same.

**Doctor**: Got it. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine, how would you rate your discomfort right now?

**Patient**: Right now, I’d rate the pain around a 6 out of 10. It’s definitely uncomfortable, but not unbearable.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your recovery overall—have you noticed any redness, swelling, warmth, or drainage from the surgical area? These could be signs of infection, so it’s important to check.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any redness, swelling, warmth, or drainage from the area. It’s mainly just the pain that’s been bothering me.

**Doctor**: Alright. Does this discomfort make it hard for you to sit, walk, or do your usual daily activities, or is it mainly just noticeable when you're at rest?

**Patient**: Sitting definitely makes it more noticeable, and it can get in the way of my usual activities. Walking isn’t too bad, but I feel the discomfort most when I’m sitting or resting.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your discomfort is localized to the surgical site and hasn’t changed much since the procedure. The absence of redness, swelling, warmth, or drainage is reassuring, as these are often signs of infection. What you’re experiencing is likely related to the healing process after surgery—especially since sitting puts pressure on that area, which can make it more noticeable.

After a procedure to close a sore like a decubital ulcer, it’s common for the area to remain tender or achy for some time as tissues heal. This can last days to weeks, depending on how deep the original sore was and your body’s healing pace.

To help with comfort, you might try using a cushion designed to relieve pressure when sitting, changing positions frequently, and avoiding prolonged sitting if possible. Gentle movement, as you’ve noticed, is usually less aggravating.

If you develop any new symptoms—such as increasing pain, redness, swelling, warmth, fever, or drainage from the area—it would be important to reach out promptly, as those could indicate infection or a problem with healing.

Let me know if you have any questions about this or if there’s anything else you’re concerned about right now.

**Patient**: Thanks, that explanation helps. I’ll try using a cushion and moving around more like you suggested. I do feel pretty agitated lately because the pain makes it hard to relax, but knowing it’s part of the healing process is a relief.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 47-year-old male presenting with left groin pain extending over the perineum and scrotum following a recent incision and drainage procedure for a left subgluteal wound infection. Symptoms included fever (temperature 102.9°F), agitation, and a full-thickness 8 cm wound with purulence and surrounding erythema, but no crepitus. Relevant history includes spina bifida, chronic urinary tract infections, urostomy, antisocial personality disorder, polysubstance abuse, prior positive HIV test, and allergies to latex, morphine, and codeine. On admission, the patient was agitated, refusing IV access, and required psychiatric stabilization due to severe agitation and narcotic withdrawal. The documented diagnosis was left perirectal and gluteal abscess with ongoing infection. Treatment included broad-spectrum antibiotics (initially vancomycin, Zosyn, clindamycin; later switched to vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl), aggressive pain management with oxycodone and hydromorphone, wound care with dressing changes and hydrogen peroxide cleaning, and psychiatric medications (Risperidone, Klonopin, Haldol, Ativan). The patient was planned for PICC line placement and transfer to a medical/psychiatric facility for further treatment.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with aching pain localized to the right buttock, which is the main reason for the visit. The discomfort began after recent surgery to close a decubital ulcer on the right buttock and has persisted without significant change; the patient rates the pain as 6 out of 10. The pain is most noticeable when sitting and interferes with daily activities, but walking is less affected. There are no associated symptoms of redness, swelling, warmth, or drainage from the surgical site. Relevant history includes recent surgical closure of a decubital ulcer. The clinical impression is that the pain is likely related to normal healing after surgery, with no signs of infection. The treatment plan includes using a pressure-relieving cushion when sitting, changing positions frequently, avoiding prolonged sitting, and monitoring for any new symptoms such as increased pain, redness, swelling, warmth, fever, or drainage. The patient was reassured that this discomfort is common during the healing process and advised to seek care if concerning symptoms develop.
