## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: UNREALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.400
- **Justification**: While the dialogue is mostly plausible in terms of symptom exploration and patient responses, the doctor's summary and provisional explanation are not well-grounded in the provided context. The patient has a known brain tumor (right temporal mass) and is being evaluated by neurosurgery for this reason. The doctor's focus on benign vestibular/ear causes and reassurance that 'more serious neurological causes are less likely' is inappropriate and contradicts the profile. The advice to monitor for new neurological symptoms is reasonable, but the minimization of neurological risk is unsupported given the patient's diagnosis.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear, relevant, and consistent with the profile. No major improvements needed.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor should acknowledge the known brain tumor and its likely contribution to the symptoms, rather than attributing them primarily to benign vestibular or Eustachian tube issues. The reassurance about neurological causes being unlikely is inappropriate in this context.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and question-answer pairs are coherent. However, the summary and plan should be better aligned with the patient's known diagnosis and reason for evaluation.

**Safety Or Clarity**: There is a safety concern due to downplaying the neurological risk in a patient with a brain tumor. The explanation should be more cautious and tailored to the patient's actual medical context.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the sensation you're experiencing—when did you first notice this pulsatile tightness and has it changed over time?

**Patient**: I first noticed the pulsatile tightness maybe a couple weeks ago. It hasn’t really gone away, and I’ve also been having some trouble with my balance.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your balance—when you say you’re having trouble, do you feel more unsteady when standing still, walking, or does it come on with certain movements like turning your head?

**Patient**: I feel more unsteady when I’m walking, especially if I turn my head or change directions. Standing still isn’t as much of a problem.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more question—have you noticed any spinning sensation, like the room moving around you, or is it more just a feeling of unsteadiness?

**Patient**: I haven’t had any spinning sensation or the room moving around me. It’s more just a general feeling of unsteadiness and dizziness.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your headaches—how would you describe the severity, and do they tend to come on at certain times of day or with specific activities?

**Patient**: The headaches are usually mid frontal and pretty steady, not sharp, and they radiate to the back of my head. I’d say the severity is moderate—they don’t stop me from doing things, but they’re definitely noticeable. I haven’t seen a clear pattern with time of day or activities.

**Doctor**: Alright, have you noticed any changes in your vision, speech, or any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs since these symptoms began?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any changes in my vision, speech, or any weakness or numbness. I do have this pressure feeling in my right ear, though.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about that ear pressure—has it been constant, or does it come and go? And have you had any hearing changes or ringing in that ear?

**Patient**: The pressure in my right ear has been pretty constant. I haven’t had

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re dealing with a steady, moderate headache that’s been present for a couple of weeks, along with a sensation of ear pressure and some unsteadiness when walking—especially when turning your head or changing directions. These symptoms can sometimes be related to issues with the inner ear, such as vestibular dysfunction or Eustachian tube problems, which can affect both balance and create a pressure sensation. The fact that you haven’t experienced spinning, vision changes, weakness, or numbness is reassuring and makes more serious neurological causes less likely.

Common triggers for this kind of problem include recent upper respiratory infections, allergies, or even changes in air pressure. Sometimes, mild inflammation in the inner ear can cause both balance issues and headaches.

For now, I’d recommend paying attention to any new symptoms—like severe headache, double vision, trouble speaking, or weakness—since those would need more urgent evaluation. Otherwise, gentle activity, staying well hydrated, and avoiding sudden head movements may help. If your symptoms persist beyond another week or worsen, it would be a good idea to have an in-person evaluation, possibly including a check of your ears and balance system.

Let me know if you notice anything that seems to make your symptoms better or worse, or if you have questions about what we've discussed so far.

**Patient**: Thanks, that explanation helps. I’ll pay attention for any changes like you mentioned. For now, I haven’t noticed anything that clearly makes the symptoms better or worse, but I’ll keep track.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 53-year-old man presenting for evaluation of a brain tumor. He reported a history of pulsatile tightness, poor balance, dizziness, mid-frontal headaches radiating to the back of his head, and pressure in his right ear, with symptoms beginning in August 2114 and not relieved by antibiotics or physical therapy. His past medical history includes insulin-dependent diabetes, angina, and prior angioplasty with three stent placements. MRI revealed a right temporal brain mass, and he subsequently underwent a right temporal craniotomy for tumor resection. The documented diagnosis is brain tumor. Postoperatively, his neurological exam was stable and unremarkable. Treatment included Depakote 500 mg orally three times daily for one week, Decadron tapered to 2 mg twice daily over 1-2 weeks, Zantac, Percocet as needed, and continuation of his home medications (Univasc, Niacin, Atenolol, Actose). He was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled in the brain tumor clinic.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with a chief complaint of persistent, pulsatile tightness and moderate, steady mid-frontal headache radiating to the back of the head, ongoing for approximately two weeks. Key symptoms include a constant pressure sensation in the right ear and unsteadiness while walking, especially when turning the head or changing directions; there is no vertigo (spinning), vision changes, speech disturbance, weakness, or numbness. The patient denies hearing changes or ringing in the affected ear. Relevant history regarding recent infections, allergies, or other medical conditions is not specified.

The clinical impression is that the symptoms may be related to inner ear dysfunction, such as vestibular dysfunction or Eustachian tube problems, rather than a serious neurological cause. The treatment plan includes monitoring for new or worsening symptoms (such as severe headache, double vision, speech difficulty, or weakness), maintaining gentle activity, staying hydrated, and avoiding sudden head movements. The patient is advised to seek in-person evaluation if symptoms persist beyond another week or worsen. No medications or specific interventions were prescribed at this time.
