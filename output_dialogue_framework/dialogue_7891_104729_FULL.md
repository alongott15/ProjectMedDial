## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the symptom (bilateral arm heaviness), screens for concerning features (weakness, numbness, pain, infection), and considers benign causes. The patient responses are clear and match the scenario. The doctor's explanation and advice are reasonable for a mild, non-progressive symptom in a patient with coronary artery disease and prior CABG, without introducing unsupported diagnoses or interventions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For added realism, the patient could mention any specific activities that trigger the sensation or express mild concern about their heart history, but this is optional.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's questioning is thorough and empathetic. For completeness, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's cardiac history when discussing benign vs. concerning causes, but the current approach is safe and reasonable.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical, with each question building on previous answers. The summary and plan are well-articulated, and the patient is given a chance to confirm understanding.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The doctor appropriately advises monitoring for worsening symptoms and provides clear guidance on when to seek further care.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the arm heaviness—when did you first notice this sensation?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think I first noticed the heaviness in both arms a few days ago.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily routine—does this heaviness make it harder for you to do things like brushing your hair, lifting objects, or getting dressed?

**Patient**: It doesn't really stop me from doing those things, but I do notice the heaviness sometimes when I'm using my arms more.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in your arms, or elsewhere in your body?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain—just the occasional heaviness in both arms.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if the heaviness happens more at a certain time of day, or when you’re doing specific activities?

**Patient**: I notice the heaviness a bit more when I’m doing things with my arms, but I haven’t paid attention to a specific time of day.

**Doctor**: Got it. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being very mild and 10 being extremely heavy or bothersome, how would you rate the sensation when it’s at its worst?

**Patient**: I’d rate it around a 3 or 4 when it feels the heaviest. It’s uncomfortable, but not really painful.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more question—have you had any recent changes in your activity level, new exercises, or any heavy lifting that might have brought this on?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t changed my routine or started any new activities. I haven’t done any heavy lifting lately either.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your general health—have you had any recent illnesses, fevers, or infections? Sometimes feeling heavy or tired in the arms can be linked to things like a mild viral illness or just overall fatigue.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any recent illnesses, fevers, or infections. I’ve been feeling about the same otherwise.

**Doctor**: That's helpful to know. Has the sensation of heaviness been staying about the same, or have you noticed it getting better or worse over the past few days?

**Patient**: It’s been about the same over the past few days—hasn’t really gotten better or worse.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like the heaviness in your arms is mild, doesn’t interfere with your daily activities, and hasn’t been getting worse. Since you haven’t had any weakness, numbness, pain, or signs of infection, this suggests it’s likely a benign issue—possibly related to muscle fatigue or mild circulation changes, which can happen as we age.

It’s a good sign that you’re able to continue your usual activities and that there’s no progression. I’d recommend keeping an eye on it for now. Gentle stretching and staying active can sometimes help with mild sensations like this. If you notice new symptoms—such as true weakness, severe pain, chest discomfort, or if the heaviness gets much worse—those would be reasons to let your doctor know promptly.

Otherwise, it’s reasonable to monitor for the next week or two. If the sensation persists or bothers you more, we can explore further. Does that sound reasonable to you?

**Patient**: That sounds reasonable to me. I appreciate you explaining it—I’ll keep an eye on things and let you know if anything changes. Thank you for your guidance.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 76-year-old female presenting with occasional bilateral arm heaviness occurring both at rest and with exertion. She denied associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. Her medical history includes coronary artery disease (question of prior myocardial infarction), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, retinopathy, bilateral cataracts, and incontinence; she has no known drug allergies and is on multiple medications including Prinivil, Toprol, Glucophage, Glyburide, ocular drops, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed. Cardiac evaluation revealed a positive exercise treadmill test and cardiac catheterization showed proximal LAD occlusion, significant left circumflex and RCA disease. On admission, laboratory values were notable for glucose 151 mg/dL and creatinine 1.2 mg/dL. The documented diagnosis was multivessel coronary artery disease. She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) times two with LIMA to LAD and SVG to OM1. Postoperatively, she was extubated on day one and weaned off NeoSynephrine drip without complications.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with a chief complaint of heaviness in both arms, first noticed a few days ago. The heaviness is occasional, rated at 3–4 out of 10 in severity, and is more noticeable during arm use but does not interfere with daily activities such as brushing hair, lifting objects, or getting dressed. The patient denied any numbness, tingling, weakness, pain, recent changes in activity level, heavy lifting, recent illnesses, fevers, or infections. The sensation has remained stable over the past few days without improvement or worsening. On examination, there were no additional physical findings reported. The doctor assessed the arm heaviness as mild and likely benign, possibly related to muscle fatigue or mild circulation changes. The doctor recommended monitoring the symptoms for the next week or two, continuing gentle stretching and regular activity, and advised the patient to report any new symptoms such as true weakness, severe pain, chest discomfort, or worsening heaviness. The patient agreed to this plan and showed understanding of the recommendations.
