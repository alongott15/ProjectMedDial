## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks relevant, focused questions about exertional chest pressure, shortness of breath, and claudication, which align with the patient's known coronary artery disease and diabetes. The patient responses are plausible and detailed, and the doctor's reasoning and recommendations are appropriate for a primary care setting. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced. The conversation is clear, logical, and avoids hallucinations.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses concerns appropriately. Could elaborate slightly more on medication adherence or other symptoms if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. Could briefly confirm current medications or ask about diabetes/hypertension control for completeness.

**Conversation Flow**: Dialogue flows naturally, with logical progression from symptom description to assessment and recommendations. The closing is supportive and clear.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate for a light case, with clear instructions on when to seek urgent care. Clarity is excellent; no concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me what’s been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been having this pressure in my chest lately. It's been making me pretty anxious, to be honest.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you tend to notice this pressure—does it come on at certain times of day, or is there anything in particular that seems to bring it on?

**Patient**: I usually notice the chest pressure when I’m walking, especially if I go more than a block. It doesn’t seem tied to a particular time of day.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—when you feel this pressure, do you also experience shortness of breath or any discomfort spreading to your arm or jaw?

**Patient**: Yes, I do get shortness of breath when the chest pressure comes on. Sometimes the pain spreads down my left arm as well.

**Doctor**: Got it. Can you tell me how long the pressure and discomfort usually last once they start, and if resting helps it go away?

**Patient**: Resting does help, and the pressure usually eases up after a few minutes if I stop moving. I also notice my legs start to ache after walking about a block, so I have to take breaks pretty often.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your legs—when you have to stop because of the aching, do you notice any numbness, tingling, or changes in the color or temperature of your feet?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed numbness or tingling in my feet. I don’t think the color or temperature has changed either. It’s mainly just aching in my legs after walking.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about what the chest pressure and arm discomfort actually feel like—would you describe it as sharp, dull, squeezing, or something else? And on a scale from 1 to 10, how intense does it get at its worst?

**Patient**: The pressure feels more like a squeezing or tightness, and the pain in my arm is dull, not sharp. At its worst, I’d rate it around a 6 out of 10.

**Doctor**: Got it. When the tightness and arm discomfort come on, do you ever feel lightheaded, nauseous, or break out in a sweat?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t felt lightheaded or nauseous when the tightness and arm pain come on. I also haven’t broken out in a sweat during those times.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about when you first started noticing these symptoms—has this been going on for days, weeks, or longer?

**Patient**: I’ve had these symptoms for a few weeks now. The chest pressure and shortness of breath started gradually and have been happening more often lately.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms—pressure in your chest with exertion, shortness of breath, and discomfort radiating to your arm, along with leg aching after walking—sound like they could be related to how your heart and blood vessels are working during activity. The fact that these symptoms improve with rest is important, as it suggests they may be brought on by increased demand on your heart or circulation.

What often happens in cases like this is that the blood supply to the heart or legs can't quite keep up when you're active, leading to these sensations. This doesn't always mean something severe is happening right now, but it does mean we should take it seriously and look into it further.

My recommendation is that you see a healthcare provider soon for a more thorough evaluation, which may include an EKG, blood tests, and possibly a stress test or imaging to check your heart and circulation. In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity that brings on your symptoms. If you notice any new symptoms such as severe or persistent chest pain, fainting, or sudden weakness, seek medical attention right away.

Let me know if you have any questions about what we've discussed or about next steps.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I understand why you want to look into it further, and I’ll make sure to avoid pushing myself for now. Should I keep taking my current medications as usual until I see someone?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 40-year-old woman presenting with chest pressure as the chief complaint. She experienced daily chest pressure for one week, mostly on exertion, associated with shortness of breath and occasional radiation to the left arm; the pain occurred at rest the evening before admission and resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin. She also reported claudication after walking one block and denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or palpitations. Her relevant history includes longstanding diabetes mellitus, three-vessel coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, left femoral popliteal bypass, and remote tobacco use. On physical exam, she was stable with clear lungs, regular heart rhythm with a soft systolic ejection murmur, and positive bilateral pulses. The documented diagnosis is three-vessel coronary artery disease with recent unstable angina symptoms. The treatment plan included cardiac catheterization and continuation of medications such as aspirin, Lipitor, insulin, atenolol, Plavix, Zestril, and Nexium.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with chest pressure that has been occurring for several weeks, particularly during walking more than a block, and causing anxiety. Symptoms include exertional chest pressure described as squeezing or tightness (rated 6/10 at worst), shortness of breath, dull discomfort radiating down the left arm, and aching in the legs after walking, all of which improve with rest. The patient denied numbness, tingling, changes in color or temperature of the feet, lightheadedness, nausea, or sweating during episodes. No specific medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned in this encounter. On examination, no physical findings were described; symptoms were reported by the patient. The doctor assessed that these symptoms may be related to cardiac or vascular function during activity, possibly due to insufficient blood supply during exertion. The doctor recommended prompt evaluation by a healthcare provider, including possible EKG, blood tests, and stress testing or imaging, advised avoiding strenuous activity that triggers symptoms, and instructed the patient to seek immediate care if severe or new symptoms develop.
