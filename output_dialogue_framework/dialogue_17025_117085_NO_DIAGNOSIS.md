## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is realistic and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, open-ended questions about the chief complaint and relevant associated symptoms (dysphagia, erythema). The patient responses are plausible and align with the profile. There are no hallucinations, unsupported content, or role confusion. The simulation ends due to a technical issue, not a content problem.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Continue providing clear, relevant answers to the doctor's questions. If possible, elaborate on symptom details (e.g., describing the sensation or changes in the lump).

**Doctor Side**: Excellent job eliciting a focused history. Consider also asking about risk factors (e.g., tobacco/alcohol use) or systemic symptoms if the conversation continued.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural. The abrupt end is due to a technical issue; otherwise, the conversation was progressing well.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns identified in the dialogue as presented.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in today. What’s been going on that brought you in—can you tell me more about what you’ve noticed or what’s concerning you most right now?

**Patient**: I’ve noticed a lump in the floor of my mouth, and it’s been bothering me. That’s mainly why I came in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the lump—when did you first notice it, and has it changed in size or sensation since then?

**Patient**: I first noticed the lump a few days ago. I’m not really sure if it’s gotten bigger, but it does feel a bit odd compared to when I first found it.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other changes—have you noticed any pain, changes in how you swallow, or any unusual taste or drainage from that area?

**Patient**: I’ve had some mild trouble swallowing lately. Also, the area around where the lump is looks a bit red. I haven’t noticed any unusual taste or drainage.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does the lump feel firm or soft to the touch, and is it tender when you press on it or move your tongue?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 54-year-old male presenting for surgical management of a mass in the floor of the mouth. He reported noticing the mass prior to admission, which was determined to require resection and reconstruction. There is no other past medical or pertinent family history documented. On examination and during his hospital course, he underwent resection of the floor of the mouth with mandibulectomy, bilateral neck dissection, tooth extraction, tracheostomy placement, and free radial left osseocutaneous flap without operative complications. The documented diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth. Postoperatively, he developed mild erythema around his incision, for which he was started on Keflex. A speech and swallow study showed mild dysphagia, and he was transitioned from tube feeds to a puree diet, which he tolerated. At discharge, his nasogastric tube and tracheostomy were removed, and he was prescribed Keflex and Roxicet elixir, with plans for home wound care and speech therapy services.
