## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and presents a plausible, stepwise clinical reasoning process for a light case involving epistaxis, hematemesis, and mild abdominal pain. The doctor asks appropriate follow-up questions, explores medication history, and provides reasonable recommendations based on the information given. There are no unsupported diagnoses or treatments, and the conversation remains focused on the patient's symptoms and relevant risk factors. The patient responses are coherent and align with the profile.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient could provide more detail about the frequency and duration of symptoms if prompted, but overall responses are appropriate and realistic.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor could clarify the plan for further evaluation (e.g., mention possible need for labs or referral if symptoms worsen) and explicitly address whether to continue verapamil and Chinese herbs, as the patient asks about them.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with clear transitions between topics. The summary and recommendations are well-placed. The conversation could be improved by closing with a clear next step or follow-up plan.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No major safety concerns. The recommendation to stop aspirin and ibuprofen is appropriate. The doctor should directly answer the patient's question about verapamil and Chinese herbs to ensure clarity.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some nosebleeds and then I ended up throwing up blood. That's why I came in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the nosebleeds—how often have you been experiencing them, and do they usually last a long time?

**Patient**: It's happened a few times lately, but I'm not sure exactly how often. They last a little while, not just a quick bleed. I also noticed some abdominal pain along with this.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the vomiting—was the blood bright red, dark, or did it look like coffee grounds? And did you have any nausea before this happened?

**Patient**: The blood I threw up looked pretty dark. I did feel some nausea before it happened.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if anything seems to trigger the nosebleeds or the abdominal discomfort, such as certain activities, medications, or changes in your environment?

**Patient**: I haven't noticed anything in particular that triggers the nosebleeds or the abdominal pain. They just seem to come on their own.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you have these episodes, do you ever feel lightheaded or notice any weakness or changes in your energy level afterwards?

**Patient**: No, I haven't really noticed feeling lightheaded or weak after these episodes. My energy level seems about the same.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more question—how much would you say these episodes are affecting your daily life? Are you able to go about your usual activities, or have you had to change your routine because of them?

**Patient**: I'm still able to do most of my usual activities, but it's definitely uncomfortable and distracting when these symptoms happen. I haven't had to change my routine much yet.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the abdominal pain—how would you describe the intensity, and does it come and go or stay constant when it happens?

**Patient**: The abdominal pain isn't very severe, but it's uncomfortable. It tends to come and go rather than staying constant.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your medical history—are you currently taking any medications, especially blood thinners or aspirin, or do you have any known bleeding or liver disorders?

**Patient**: Yes, I'm currently taking verapamil, aspirin, ibuprofen, and some Chinese herbs. I don't have any known bleeding or liver disorders.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you've had several episodes of nosebleeds and recently vomited dark blood, along with some intermittent abdominal discomfort. The fact that you're taking both aspirin and ibuprofen is important, since these medications can sometimes irritate the stomach lining and increase the risk of bleeding, especially when used together.

Vomiting dark blood often suggests that the bleeding may be coming from the stomach or upper digestive tract rather than just the nose. While your symptoms aren't severe at the moment and you're able to continue with daily activities, it's important to monitor for any signs of worsening, such as persistent vomiting, heavy bleeding, feeling faint, or black, tarry stools.

For now, I recommend pausing the use of aspirin and ibuprofen until we can evaluate further, as these could be contributing to your symptoms. Also, try to keep track of any future episodes—the timing, severity, and anything that seems to trigger them. If you notice any new or worsening symptoms, please seek care promptly.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about these recommendations, or if you'd like to discuss next steps.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining that. I have noticed some dark, tarry stools as well, now that you mention it. I'll stop taking the aspirin and ibuprofen like you said. Should I keep taking the verapamil and the Chinese herbs?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 64-year-old female presenting with epistaxis followed by hematemesis. She reported left-sided nosebleed, swallowing blood, abdominal pain, and bloody hematemesis, with a history of frequent nosebleeds, recent coffee ground emesis, and seven to eight days of dark or tarry stools and crampy abdominal pain. Her past medical history includes hypertension and cholecystectomy, and she was taking verapamil, aspirin, ibuprofen, and unspecified Chinese herbs on admission; she has no known allergies. On evaluation, she was found to have active bleeding in the posterior pharynx and mild gastritis on endoscopy, with stable anemia and no evidence of gastrointestinal ulceration or ongoing bleeding. The documented diagnoses were epistaxis, posterior pharyngeal bleeding, mild gastritis, and anemia. Treatment included placement of Merocel in the left naris, discontinuation of aspirin and ibuprofen, initiation of Keflex 500 mg orally four times daily for five days, Protonix 40 mg daily for six weeks, and ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily for six months. She was advised to continue verapamil for hypertension and to follow up with ENT and her primary care physician the following week. The patient was discharged home in stable condition.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with episodes of nosebleeds and recent hematemesis (vomiting dark blood). Symptoms include several recent nosebleeds of moderate duration, intermittent mild abdominal pain, preceding nausea before vomiting, and the presence of dark, tarry stools (melena). The patient denies lightheadedness or weakness and reports no significant impact on daily activities. Relevant history includes current use of verapamil, aspirin, ibuprofen, and Chinese herbs, with no known bleeding or liver disorders. The clinical impression is upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely exacerbated by concurrent use of aspirin and ibuprofen. The treatment plan includes discontinuing aspirin and ibuprofen and monitoring for worsening symptoms such as persistent vomiting, heavy bleeding, faintness, or black stools. The patient was advised to track future episodes and seek prompt care if symptoms worsen.
