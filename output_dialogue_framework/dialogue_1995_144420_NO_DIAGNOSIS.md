## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly realistic for a primary-care setting with a patient presenting with worsening claudication, post-operative symptoms, and possible infection. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about pain, swelling, redness, fever, and other relevant symptoms. The patient responses are consistent with the profile and provide plausible details. The doctor's summary and recommendations are clear, medically appropriate, and do not introduce unsupported content. There are no obvious hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and volunteers additional symptoms when prompted. For even greater realism, the patient could ask a clarifying question or express concern about the seriousness of the situation.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates excellent clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly check for other systemic symptoms (e.g., confusion, chest pain) or clarify the timeline of surgery for completeness.

**Conversation Flow**: The conversation flows logically and naturally, with each turn building on the previous one. The transition to recommendations is smooth. Consider adding a closing statement or confirming the patient's understanding at the end.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety is well addressed by urging prompt evaluation and providing clear warning signs. The explanation of possible infection is clear and appropriate for a light case with concerning symptoms.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What’s been bothering you the most lately?

**Patient**: I've been having more pain in my leg when I walk, and it's starting to make it harder for me to get around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain—can you describe what it feels like? For example, is it aching, sharp, cramping, or something else?

**Patient**: The pain feels like a cramping and aching in my leg, especially when I walk. It's been getting worse lately and makes it tough for me to go very far.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something related—have you noticed any swelling, changes in skin color, or temperature in your leg? Sometimes these details can help us understand what's causing the discomfort.

**Patient**: Yes, the leg that was operated on has been swollen, and I've noticed some redness that seems to spread away from the incision. The area also feels warmer than usual.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you had any fever or chills along with the swelling and redness? Sometimes these symptoms can help us tell if there’s an infection or inflammation going on.

**Patient**: I've had a temperature over 100.5 for about a day, but I don't recall having chills. The pain also got a lot worse suddenly and isn't really controlled by my usual pain medication.

**Doctor**: Got it. When did you first notice the swelling and redness, and has it changed quickly or gradually over time?

**Patient**: I noticed the swelling and redness a few days ago, and it seems like it’s gotten worse pretty quickly since then.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something else that could be connected—have you noticed any swelling or tenderness around your jaw or neck, like under your ear or near your cheek? Sometimes issues in those areas can relate to overall inflammation.

**Patient**: Yes, my left parotid gland has been swollen. It's tender around that area, too.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything seem to make the leg pain or the swelling better or worse—like resting, elevating your leg, or taking certain medications?

**Patient**: Resting and keeping my leg elevated does help with the swelling a bit, but the pain doesn’t really get better, even with my usual pain medication.

**Doctor**: Okay. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine, how would you rate the pain in your leg right now?

**Patient**: Right now, I’d rate the pain at about an 8. It’s pretty intense and makes it hard for me to move around.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you have a combination of rapidly worsening discomfort in your leg after surgery, along with swelling, redness, warmth, and a fever. You also mentioned tenderness and swelling in your left parotid gland. These symptoms suggest there may be an infection, possibly related to your surgical site, and the involvement of the parotid gland may mean your body is reacting more broadly.

Infections can sometimes spread quickly, especially after surgery, and require prompt attention. The fact that your pain is severe and not relieved by medication, along with the new swelling and redness, are signs that this isn't just typical post-operative soreness.

My recommendation is to contact your surgical team or primary care provider as soon as possible today for an in-person evaluation. They may want to examine you, run some tests, and possibly start antibiotics if infection is confirmed. While resting and elevating your leg helps with swelling, these symptoms need medical attention.

If you notice increasing fever, confusion, difficulty breathing, or spreading redness, seek care immediately. Would you like advice on how to reach your care team or discuss what to expect at your visit?

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I have noticed some drainage from the wound at my thigh, and I've been feeling more tired than usual. I’ll contact my care team today like you suggested.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 73-year-old female presenting with claudication as the chief complaint. She reported several weeks of worsening pain with walking, progressing to significant claudication. Her relevant history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, pancytopenia of unclear etiology, hypertension, and bilateral carotid endarterectomy; she also has allergies to Glucophage, morphine, and codeine. On physical exam, there was +2 edema in the right lower extremity and surgical changes consistent with recent bypass grafting, as well as a left swollen parotid gland consistent with parotitis. Laboratory findings showed pancytopenia (WBC 5.8, Hgb 10.1, Hct 29.9, Plt 61), mild renal insufficiency (UreaN 37), and elevated AST and total bilirubin. The documented diagnosis was peripheral vascular disease with claudication. She underwent a femoral/popliteal PTFE graft with distal PTFE to posterior tibial bypass vein graft. The treatment plan included surgical intervention and post-operative wound care.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with worsening leg pain during walking, making mobility difficult. Symptoms included cramping and aching pain in the operated leg, rated 8/10 in severity, with rapid onset of swelling, redness spreading from the incision, increased warmth, and a fever over 100.5°F for about a day; pain was not relieved by usual medication and improved only slightly with rest and elevation. The patient also reported new swelling and tenderness of the left parotid gland, wound drainage from the thigh, and increased fatigue. Relevant history includes recent leg surgery; no medication names or allergies were specified. On examination, the doctor noted rapidly worsening discomfort, severe pain, swelling, redness, warmth, fever, and parotid gland involvement. The assessment was possible infection related to the surgical site with systemic involvement. The doctor advised urgent contact with the surgical team or primary care provider for in-person evaluation, possible testing, and antibiotics if infection is confirmed, and emphasized seeking immediate care for worsening symptoms such as increasing fever, confusion, difficulty breathing, or spreading redness.
