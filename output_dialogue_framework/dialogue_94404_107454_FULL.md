## Judge Evaluation

- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks relevant, open-ended questions about withdrawal symptoms, their timing, severity, and impact on daily life.

The doctor summarizes findings appropriately and gives clear, safe advice about warning signs and supportive care. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Doctor Side**: Doctor is thorough and empathetic. Could briefly mention options for follow-up or support resources for anxiety/depression to enhance completeness.

**Conversation Flow**: Dialogue flows logically from symptom exploration to assessment and advice. The transition to discussing anxiety/depression is smooth.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety is well addressed with clear warning signs. Clarity is high; the doctor explains reasoning and next steps. No concerns.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hi, welcome in today. Can you tell me more about what’s been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some trouble with alcohol withdrawal. Lately, I've been feeling really shaky and it's making things tough.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when the shakiness tends to come on—does it happen more in the mornings, or throughout the day? Have you noticed if anything makes it better or worse?

**Patient**: It mostly happens in the mornings, but sometimes it sticks around during the day too. I’ve noticed it gets a bit better if I try to stay calm or sit down for a while.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your day-to-day—how much are these symptoms affecting your ability to do things like work, errands, or time with family?

**Patient**: It's making it tough to focus at work, and I've felt pretty agitated and even a bit confused at times. I haven't really been able to keep up with things like I normally would.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your sleep—have you been able to rest well, or are you having trouble falling or staying asleep lately?

**Patient**: Sleep has been pretty rough. I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, and when I do sleep, it doesn’t feel restful.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about feeling sedated or drowsy—do you ever feel unusually tired or sluggish during the day, or is it mostly just the shakiness and trouble with sleep?

**Patient**: Yes, I do feel unusually tired and kind of sluggish during the day, not just shaky. The drowsiness makes it hard to get much done.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shakiness and tiredness, like sweating, heart racing, or changes in appetite?

**Patient**: I haven’t really noticed sweating or my heart racing, and my appetite hasn’t changed much. Mostly it’s the tremors, feeling sedated, and the other withdrawal symptoms.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about when these symptoms first started—was there a specific time you stopped drinking, or have you been cutting down gradually? This helps me understand how your body is adjusting.

**Patient**: I stopped drinking pretty suddenly a few days ago, so the symptoms started not long after that. Along with the physical stuff, my anxiety and depression have been acting up more too.

**Doctor**: Alright. Can you tell me if you've had any symptoms like seeing or hearing things that aren't really there, or if you've felt confused to the point of not knowing where you are? This helps me gauge how your withdrawal is progressing.

**Patient**: I haven't seen or heard things that aren't there. I have felt confused at times, but not so much that I didn't know where I was.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you're experiencing mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms—things like tremors, feeling tired, trouble sleeping, and some agitation or confusion. These symptoms often start within a day or two after stopping drinking, especially if the change is sudden. The body gets used to alcohol over time, so withdrawal can affect your nerves and sleep until things rebalance.

From what you've shared, you haven't had more severe symptoms like hallucinations or major disorientation, which is reassuring. For most people, these symptoms gradually improve over several days. Staying hydrated, eating regular meals, and resting when you can may help ease things along. If you notice new symptoms—such as severe confusion, fever, chest pain, or if you start seeing or hearing things that aren't there—those are warning signs to seek medical attention right away.

Let me know if you have questions about managing these symptoms at home or if you'd like advice about support for anxiety and depression during this time.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I appreciate knowing what to watch for. Is there anything specific I can do to help with the anxiety and depression while I’m going through this?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 40-year-old male presenting with alcohol withdrawal. He experienced agitation, confusion, tremulousness, tachycardia (HR up to 109), hypertension (BP up to 157/117), and a high CIWA score of 30, with symptoms improving after administration of IV diazepam and lorazepam. Relevant history includes depression, suicidal ideation, alcohol abuse, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, GERD, and possible NASH; there are no known drug allergies. The documented diagnoses were alcohol withdrawal, depression, transaminitis (elevated liver enzymes likely due to alcohol use), and GERD. Treatment included benzodiazepines (diazepam and lorazepam), supportive care with IV fluids, multivitamin, thiamine, folate, continuation of PPI for GERD, and psychiatric consultation. Upon discharge, the patient was stable, tolerating oral intake, and ambulating, and was transferred to an extended care psychiatric facility. Discharge medications included bupropion, pantoprazole, lorazepam, senna, and docusate sodium. Follow-up with primary care was advised within 1-2 weeks to monitor liver function tests.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with concerns related to alcohol withdrawal. Key symptoms include morning-predominant tremors (shakiness), persistent fatigue and drowsiness, difficulty with sleep initiation and maintenance, daytime sluggishness, agitation, and intermittent mild confusion, but without hallucinations, severe disorientation, sweating, palpitations, or appetite changes. These symptoms began a few days ago after the patient abruptly stopped drinking alcohol; the patient also reports worsening anxiety and depression during this period. There is no mention of relevant medical history, medications, or allergies.

The documented clinical impression is mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The physician advised that these symptoms typically improve over several days and recommended supportive measures such as staying hydrated, eating regular meals, and resting. The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention if severe symptoms develop, including hallucinations, major confusion, fever, or chest pain. Further advice regarding management of anxiety and depression during withdrawal was offered if the patient desired.
