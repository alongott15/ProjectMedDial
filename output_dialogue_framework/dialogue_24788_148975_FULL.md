## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly plausible for a primary-care encounter with a patient who has exertional angina, shortness of breath, and dizziness in the context of known aortic stenosis and other comorbidities. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the nature, timing, and triggers of symptoms, and provides clear explanations and safety advice. The plan for further cardiac evaluation (EKG, possible stress test) is reasonable and does not introduce unsupported or severe interventions. The patient responses are consistent with the profile and show understanding. There are no obvious hallucinations or unsupported content.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and appropriately volunteers additional symptoms (dizziness, nausea). For even greater realism, the patient could mention any recent changes in medication or other health events if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For completeness, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's history of aortic stenosis and other comorbidities, as these are relevant to the symptoms and plan.

**Conversation Flow**: The conversation flows logically, with each question building on prior answers. The summary and safety netting are well done. Consider a brief check for other associated symptoms (e.g., palpitations, swelling) for completeness.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate. The explanation of warning signs is thorough. No safety concerns identified.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—have you noticed any new symptoms or changes in how you've been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some chest pain when I walk or do things around the house. It feels tight, and it's been making me a bit anxious.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed this—how long has this tightness been happening when you’re active?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been going on for a couple of weeks now when I try to be more active.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what happens when you rest—does the tightness go away once you stop being active, or does it linger for a while afterward?

**Patient**: Once I stop and rest, the tightness usually goes away after a few minutes. It doesn't really linger if I'm sitting down.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your breathing—when you feel this tightness, do you also get short of breath or feel like you can’t catch your breath?

**Patient**: Yes, I do get short of breath when my chest feels tight. It makes it tough to keep going, so I have to stop and catch my breath.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you feel this tightness and shortness of breath, does it ever come on when you're resting, or is it only with activity?

**Patient**: No, it only happens when I'm doing something active. I don't get the tightness or shortness of breath when I'm just sitting or resting.

**Doctor**: Alright. Over the past couple of weeks, would you say this has been staying about the same, getting worse, or improving at all?

**Patient**: I'd say it's been about the same these past couple of weeks. It hasn't really gotten worse, but it hasn't improved either.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much would you say this is impacting your ability to do your usual daily activities around the house? Are there things you’ve had to cut back on because of this?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve definitely had to slow down. Things like making the bed or going up the stairs leave me more tired and out of breath than usual, so I take more breaks now.

**Doctor**: Okay. When you feel this tightness, does it ever spread anywhere else—like your arm, neck, jaw, or back—or does it stay in your chest?

**Patient**: No, the tightness just stays in my chest. It doesn’t go into my arm, neck, jaw, or back.

**Doctor**: From what you've described, it sounds like the chest tightness and shortness of breath only come on with activity and reliably improve when you rest. This pattern is often seen in a condition called angina, which happens when the heart muscle isn’t getting enough blood flow during exertion. It’s common for this to make people slow down or take more breaks with daily chores.

What often happens with angina is that the heart’s demand for oxygen goes up when you’re active, and if there’s some narrowing in the heart’s blood vessels, you can get these symptoms. The fact that your symptoms don’t occur at rest and haven’t gotten worse is somewhat reassuring, but it’s still important to address them.

For now, I’d recommend taking things at a slower pace and avoiding strenuous activity until we can look into this further. If you ever notice the tightness coming on at rest, lasting longer than usual, or if you develop new symptoms like nausea, sweating, or pain spreading to your arm or jaw, those would be warning signs to seek immediate medical attention.

Let’s arrange for you to be evaluated further—this often involves checking your heart with an EKG and possibly some other tests to see how your heart is functioning during activity. Does that plan sound reasonable to you?

**Patient**: That makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I have noticed a little dizziness and some nausea when the chest tightness happens—should I mention that during the tests? Otherwise, your plan sounds good to me.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms sound consistent with what we call exertional angina—chest tightness and shortness of breath that come on with activity and improve with rest. The fact that you've also noticed some dizziness and nausea at those times is important, as it can sometimes happen when the heart isn't getting enough oxygen during exertion.

Here’s how I’m thinking about it: when you’re active, your heart needs more oxygen-rich blood. If there’s narrowing in your heart’s blood vessels, that demand might not be fully met, leading to these symptoms. The dizziness and nausea are likely related to the same process.

The next step should be a careful evaluation of your heart, which typically includes an EKG and possibly a stress test or other imaging to see how your heart responds to activity. Please do mention the dizziness and nausea during your tests, as these details help guide the evaluation and treatment plan.

For now, it’s wise to avoid pushing yourself with activity and to take breaks as needed. If you notice any changes—like these symptoms coming on while you’re resting, lasting longer than usual, or if you experience new signs such as sweating, pain spreading to your arm or jaw, or fainting—those are reasons to seek urgent care.

We’ll work together to get some answers and help you feel safer and more comfortable with your daily activities. Does that help clarify things for you?

**Patient**: Thank you, that does help clear things up. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’ll make sure to mention all my symptoms during the tests and take it easy until then.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 78-year-old female presenting with exertional angina, shortness of breath (SOB), and dizziness. She reported angina and dyspnea on exertion, with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and recent cardiac catheterization showing moderate coronary artery disease and severe AS. Her past medical history includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, GERD, osteoporosis, cataracts, bladder prolapse, and a recent fall; she has allergies to Lisinopril, Diovan, and latex. The documented diagnoses at discharge were aortic stenosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, osteoporosis, cataracts, bladder prolapse, left inguinal hernia, right adrenal cyst, prior abdominal resuspension, hemorrhoid repair, and breast implant. During admission, she underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) and repair of the coronary sinus. Postoperatively, she was managed with beta-blockade, gentle diuresis, and discontinuation of ACE inhibitors due to allergy concerns. Discharge medications included atorvastatin, aspirin, metoprolol, omeprazole, potassium chloride, furosemide, docusate sodium, and acetaminophen-codeine as needed. She was discharged home in good condition with instructions for wound care, activity restrictions, and follow-up appointments in 2 and 4 weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with chest pain described as tightness occurring during physical activity. Symptoms have been present for approximately two weeks, are triggered by exertion (such as walking, making the bed, or climbing stairs), and reliably resolve within minutes of rest; associated symptoms include shortness of breath, dizziness, and occasional nausea during episodes. The patient denies radiation of pain to the arm, neck, jaw, or back and reports no symptoms at rest. There is no mention of relevant past medical history, medications, or allergies in the dialogue. The clinical impression documented by the physician is exertional angina, likely due to insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle during activity. The treatment plan includes advising the patient to avoid strenuous activity, take breaks as needed, and monitor for any worsening or new symptoms such as pain at rest, sweating, or pain radiating to other areas. Further evaluation is planned with an EKG and possibly a stress test or cardiac imaging to assess heart function during exertion. The patient was instructed to report all symptoms during testing and to seek urgent care if warning signs develop.
