## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the symptoms, duration, severity, and relevant medications. The explanation of possible causes and the advice to seek further evaluation are appropriate for a light case with melena and mild anemia symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses or treatments, and the conversation remains focused on the patient's reported symptoms. The only minor omission is that the doctor does not explicitly answer the patient's question about stopping Naprosyn, but this does not detract significantly from realism.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and asks a reasonable follow-up question. For improvement, the patient could mention any other over-the-counter medications or supplements if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor should directly address the patient's question about whether to stop Naprosyn, as this is important for safety.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate transitions between history-taking, explanation, and safety netting. The closing could be improved by ensuring all patient questions are answered.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The safety advice is clear and appropriate. However, the doctor should clarify whether to stop Naprosyn immediately, as continued use could worsen bleeding risk.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Good morning. What brings you in today, and how have you been feeling recently?

**Patient**: I've noticed my stool has been black lately, and that's got me a bit worried.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you felt lightheaded, weak, or noticed any changes in your energy levels lately?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve been feeling a bit lightheaded lately. I also get short of breath more easily than usual.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed these changes. How long have your stools been this color, and when did you start feeling lightheaded and short of breath?

**Patient**: I first noticed my stools were black maybe two or three days ago. The lightheadedness and shortness of breath started around the same time, I think.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your appetite and any stomach discomfort—have you had any pain in your abdomen, nausea, or noticed a change in how much you’re eating?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any stomach pain or nausea. My appetite seems about the same as usual.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has this change in stool color happened before, or is this the first time you've noticed it?

**Patient**: This is the first time I’ve noticed my stool looking like this. It hasn’t happened before.

**Doctor**: Got it. Has the stool color or your other symptoms been getting better, worse, or staying about the same over the past few days?

**Patient**: The black stool and my other symptoms have pretty much stayed the same over the past few days. They haven’t really gotten better or worse.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much are these symptoms affecting your daily life—are you able to do your usual activities, or do you find yourself needing to rest more often?

**Patient**: I’ve been needing to rest more often. The lightheadedness and shortness of breath make it harder to do my regular activities.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any medications or supplements you might be taking—are you on anything like iron tablets, aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs right now? Sometimes these can affect stool color.

**Patient**: I take Atorvastatin and Naprosyn. I’m not on iron tablets or aspirin.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, black stools can sometimes be caused by bleeding in the upper part of the digestive tract. The fact that you're also feeling lightheaded and short of breath, and needing to rest more, suggests your body might not be getting enough oxygen—possibly due to low blood levels from slow bleeding. Naprosyn, which is an anti-inflammatory, can sometimes irritate the stomach lining and lead to bleeding.

This combination of symptoms is important to address. While sometimes black stool can result from certain foods or medications, in your case, it’s best not to ignore it. I recommend you contact your healthcare provider soon for further evaluation—they may want to check your blood counts and possibly look at your digestive tract more closely.

In the meantime, if you notice symptoms getting worse (such as feeling faint, rapid heartbeat, or severe weakness), or if you see fresh blood in your stool or vomit, seek medical attention right away.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I appreciate you taking the time to go over my symptoms and what they might mean. I’ll make sure to get in touch with my doctor soon—should I stop taking the Naprosyn for now?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 68-year-old male presenting with melena, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. He reported awakening with lightheadedness and dyspnea, followed by a melanotic bowel movement; he denied chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hemoptysis, hematemesis, or hematuria. His past medical history includes dyslipidemia and a remote history of gastric ulcer, and he had been taking naprosyn for shoulder pain. On admission, laboratory studies showed anemia (hematocrit as low as 24.4), and nasogastric lavage returned blood-tinged fluid. The documented diagnoses were duodenal ulcer with bleeding and blood loss anemia. He was treated with intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI), received two units of packed red blood cells, and underwent EGD which revealed a non-bleeding duodenal ulcer and erosions. At discharge, his hematocrit was stable, he was tolerating food, and he was prescribed oral pantoprazole with instructions to avoid NSAIDs. He was advised to follow up with his physician within 1–16 weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with black stools as the chief complaint. Over the past two to three days, the patient has also experienced lightheadedness and increased shortness of breath, which have made it harder to perform usual activities and have required more rest. The symptoms have remained stable without improvement or worsening, and there is no abdominal pain, nausea, or change in appetite. This is the first occurrence of black stools for the patient. Relevant history includes current use of Atorvastatin and Naprosyn (naproxen), with no use of iron tablets or aspirin. The clinical impression discussed was possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding, potentially related to Naprosyn use. The doctor recommended prompt follow-up with a healthcare provider for further evaluation, including blood counts and possible gastrointestinal investigation. The patient was also advised to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or if there is evidence of fresh blood in stool or vomit.
