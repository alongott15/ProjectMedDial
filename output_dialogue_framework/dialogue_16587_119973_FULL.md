## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile (history of coronary artery disease, CABG, angina, and current symptoms of worsening chest pressure). The doctor asks appropriate follow-up questions about the nature, triggers, and relief of symptoms, and provides a reasonable explanation and safety advice. There are no unsupported diagnoses or treatments introduced. The recommendation to seek prompt cardiology follow-up and to escalate care if severe symptoms develop is appropriate for a light case with new-onset rest angina.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and describes symptom changes well. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any recent medication changes or other new health issues if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and empathetic. For completeness, the doctor could briefly confirm medication adherence or ask about any recent changes in medications or lifestyle that might contribute to symptom change.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between symptom exploration, assessment, and plan. The summary and safety netting are clear.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate and clear. The doctor avoids alarming language but emphasizes the importance of follow-up. No safety concerns detected.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing lately?

**Patient**: I've been having more chest pressure lately, and it feels stronger than before. It's even happening when I'm just sitting and not doing anything.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long these episodes usually last. When you feel this pressure, does it come and go, or is it more constant?

**Patient**: It comes and goes, not constant. Each episode usually lasts a few minutes, but lately it feels like it happens more often, even when I'm just sitting.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed things like shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded when this happens?

**Patient**: I haven't noticed any sweating or feeling lightheaded with it. I don't get short of breath when it happens, just the chest pressure.

**Doctor**: Alright. How would you rate the intensity of the pressure when it happens—would you say it's mild, moderate, or quite strong?

**Patient**: It's definitely stronger than it used to be—I'd call it moderate, maybe even close to strong sometimes.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything in particular seem to bring these episodes on or make them worse—like eating, stress, or certain movements? Or do they seem to happen randomly?

**Patient**: They seem to happen randomly now. Before, it was more with activity, but lately I can't really tell what brings it on.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what you do when the pressure comes on—does resting, changing position, or taking any medication help relieve it, or does it just go away on its own?

**Patient**: Taking my nitroglycerin patch usually helps ease the pressure. Resting sometimes makes it better too, but not always.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more thing—after you use your nitroglycerin patch, about how long does it usually take before you feel some relief?

**Patient**: Usually, I start to feel better within about 10 or 15 minutes after putting on the patch. Sometimes it takes a little longer, but that's typical for me.

**Doctor**: I see. Has the increased frequency or strength of these episodes affected your ability to do your usual daily activities, like walking around the house or running errands?

**Patient**: Yes, it's made things harder for me. I get the chest pressure even when I'm just doing simple things around the house, so I've been taking it easier lately.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your chest pressure has become more frequent and intense, and it's now happening even at rest, not just with activity. The fact that it responds to your nitroglycerin patch suggests it may be related to your heart, possibly angina, which is chest discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.

When angina symptoms become more frequent, last longer, or occur at rest, we call this "unstable angina," and it can be a warning sign that your heart needs more attention. This doesn't necessarily mean something severe is happening right now, but it's important not to ignore these changes.

Given the changes in your symptoms and their impact on your daily life, I recommend you contact your cardiologist or seek medical attention soon—even today—to discuss these new developments. In the meantime, continue to use your nitroglycerin as prescribed and avoid overexertion. If you develop any new symptoms like severe chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting, or sweating, seek emergency care right away.

Would you like help arranging a follow-up with your heart doctor or have any questions about what we've discussed?

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining that—it helps to know what might be going on. I'd appreciate help setting up an appointment with my cardiologist. Should I keep taking all my other medications as usual?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 76-year-old female presenting with worsening chest pain. She reports a history of stable angina since 2130, previously infrequent and exertional, but now occurring at rest at least twice weekly, sometimes during sleep, described as chest pressure relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin and rest. Her medical history includes angina, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent biliary stones, osteopenia, arthritis, and a shellfish allergy. Outpatient cardiac testing showed moderate inferolateral ischemia on Myoview study and an echocardiogram with 50% ejection fraction, mild aortic insufficiency, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. On physical exam, she was afebrile with blood pressure 130/80 mmHg and heart rate 70 bpm in sinus rhythm; her cardiovascular and respiratory exams were unremarkable. The documented diagnosis is progressive angina. Treatment on admission included aspirin, Actigall, Cardizem, Protonix, Lipitor, Vioxx, nitroglycerin patch, Lamisil, and atenolol.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with increased chest pressure that is now stronger and more frequent than before, occurring even at rest. The chest pressure is described as moderate to strong, comes and goes in episodes lasting a few minutes, and previously was triggered by activity but now occurs randomly, including during simple activities around the house. The patient denied associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness, and reported that the pressure is sometimes relieved within 10–15 minutes by using a nitroglycerin patch or by resting. The patient’s history includes use of nitroglycerin patches for chest pressure; no other medical history, medications, or allergies were specified. No abnormal physical findings were described in the conversation. The doctor assessed that the symptoms are consistent with unstable angina, given their increased frequency, intensity, occurrence at rest, and response to nitroglycerin. The doctor recommended contacting the patient’s cardiologist or seeking medical attention soon, continuing nitroglycerin as prescribed, avoiding overexertion, and seeking emergency care if new severe symptoms develop. The patient requested assistance arranging a cardiology follow-up and asked about continuing other medications.
