## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile (history of coronary artery disease, CABG, angina, and current symptoms of worsening chest pressure). The doctor asks appropriate follow-up questions about the nature, triggers, and relief of symptoms, and provides a reasonable explanation and safety advice. There are no unsupported diagnoses or treatments introduced. The recommendation to seek prompt cardiology follow-up and to escalate care if severe symptoms develop is appropriate for a light case with new-onset rest angina.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and describes symptom changes well. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any recent medication changes or other new health issues if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and empathetic. For completeness, the doctor could briefly confirm medication adherence or ask about any recent changes in medications or lifestyle that might contribute to symptom change.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between symptom exploration, assessment, and plan. The summary and safety netting are clear.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate and clear. The doctor avoids alarming language but emphasizes the importance of follow-up. No safety concerns detected.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing lately?

**Patient**: I've been having more chest pressure lately, and it feels stronger than before. It's even happening when I'm just sitting and not doing anything.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long these episodes usually last. When you feel this pressure, does it come and go, or is it more constant?

**Patient**: It comes and goes, not constant. Each episode usually lasts a few minutes, but lately it feels like it happens more often, even when I'm just sitting.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed things like shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded when this happens?

**Patient**: I haven't noticed any sweating or feeling lightheaded with it. I don't get short of breath when it happens, just the chest pressure.

**Doctor**: Alright. How would you rate the intensity of the pressure when it happens—would you say it's mild, moderate, or quite strong?

**Patient**: It's definitely stronger than it used to be—I'd call it moderate, maybe even close to strong sometimes.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything in particular seem to bring these episodes on or make them worse—like eating, stress, or certain movements? Or do they seem to happen randomly?

**Patient**: They seem to happen randomly now. Before, it was more with activity, but lately I can't really tell what brings it on.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what you do when the pressure comes on—does resting, changing position, or taking any medication help relieve it, or does it just go away on its own?

**Patient**: Taking my nitroglycerin patch usually helps ease the pressure. Resting sometimes makes it better too, but not always.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more thing—after you use your nitroglycerin patch, about how long does it usually take before you feel some relief?

**Patient**: Usually, I start to feel better within about 10 or 15 minutes after putting on the patch. Sometimes it takes a little longer, but that's typical for me.

**Doctor**: I see. Has the increased frequency or strength of these episodes affected your ability to do your usual daily activities, like walking around the house or running errands?

**Patient**: Yes, it's made things harder for me. I get the chest pressure even when I'm just doing simple things around the house, so I've been taking it easier lately.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your chest pressure has become more frequent and intense, and it's now happening even at rest, not just with activity. The fact that it responds to your nitroglycerin patch suggests it may be related to your heart, possibly angina, which is chest discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.

When angina symptoms become more frequent, last longer, or occur at rest, we call this "unstable angina," and it can be a warning sign that your heart needs more attention. This doesn't necessarily mean something severe is happening right now, but it's important not to ignore these changes.

Given the changes in your symptoms and their impact on your daily life, I recommend you contact your cardiologist or seek medical attention soon—even today—to discuss these new developments. In the meantime, continue to use your nitroglycerin as prescribed and avoid overexertion. If you develop any new symptoms like severe chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting, or sweating, seek emergency care right away.

Would you like help arranging a follow-up with your heart doctor or have any questions about what we've discussed?

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining that—it helps to know what might be going on. I'd appreciate help setting up an appointment with my cardiologist. Should I keep taking all my other medications as usual?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 76-year-old female presenting with worsening chest pressure consistent with angina. Over the past six months, her angina symptoms increased in frequency and intensity, now occurring at rest at least twice weekly and sometimes during sleep, with relief from sublingual nitroglycerin and rest. She has a history of angina, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent biliary stones, osteopenia, arthritis, and a shellfish allergy. Cardiac catheterization revealed significant multi-vessel coronary artery disease, and she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) without complications. The documented diagnoses include coronary artery disease status post CABG, gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent biliary stones, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and arthritis. On discharge, her condition was stable. She was prescribed medications including Lopressor, aspirin, Lipitor, Lasix (for seven days), potassium chloride (for seven days), and pain management agents, and was advised to follow up with her cardiologist in four weeks and her primary care physician in two to three weeks for blood pressure monitoring.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with increased chest pressure as the chief complaint. The chest pressure is described as moderate to strong, occurs more frequently, lasts a few minutes per episode, and now happens even at rest without clear triggers; previously, it was associated with activity. The patient denies associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness, and reports that nitroglycerin patches usually provide relief within 10–15 minutes, though resting is less consistently effective. The increased frequency and intensity of symptoms have begun to limit daily activities. Relevant history includes the use of nitroglycerin patches for symptom relief; other medical history and medications are not specified. The clinical impression documented by the doctor is unstable angina, given the change in symptom pattern and response to nitroglycerin. The treatment plan includes continuing nitroglycerin as prescribed, avoiding overexertion, and seeking prompt follow-up with a cardiologist; the patient was also advised to seek emergency care if severe symptoms develop. The doctor offered assistance in arranging a cardiology appointment and advised the patient to continue other medications as usual.
