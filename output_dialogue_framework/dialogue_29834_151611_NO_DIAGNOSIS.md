## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hi there, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what's been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've just been having some lower belly cramping since my surgery. It's not super bad, but it's definitely uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your recovery—when did you have your surgery, and has the cramping changed at all since then?

**Patient**: I'm not totally sure on the exact day, but the cramping has been pretty steady since surgery. It hasn't really gotten worse, just kind of lingers.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about anything that seems to bring the cramping on or make it worse—have you noticed if certain activities, movements, or meals affect how you feel?

**Patient**: I haven't really noticed anything specific that makes it worse. It just kind of happens, no matter what I'm doing.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you press on your lower belly, does it feel especially tender or sore to the touch?

**Patient**: Yes, it's definitely more tender when I press on it. It feels sore to the touch.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cramping, like fever, changes in your bowel movements, or any unusual discharge?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any fever or changes in my bowel movements, and nothing unusual like discharge. It's mostly just the cramping and soreness when I press on my abdomen.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much would you say this discomfort is affecting your ability to go about your usual daily activities—are you able to work, move around, and do what you need to, or is it holding you back?

**Patient**: I can still do most things, but the pain definitely makes it harder to focus and move around comfortably. I’ve been a bit more tearful than usual, too.

**Doctor**: Let me ask—have you needed to take any pain medication for this, and if so, has it helped at all? This can help me gauge how much the discomfort is impacting you and whether it’s improving with simple measures.

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve taken some pain meds, and they help a bit but don’t take it away completely. The discomfort is still there, just less intense.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your recovery overall—have you been able to eat and drink normally, and are you passing gas and having bowel movements as usual since your surgery? This helps me understand if your digestion is on track, which is important after abdominal procedures.

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve been able to eat and drink normally. Bowel movements and passing gas have both been fine since surgery.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your recovery is generally on track—you're eating, drinking, and your digestion is working well, which are all good signs after surgery. Mild abdominal discomfort and tenderness can be common as tissues heal, especially if the pain isn't getting worse and there are no signs of infection like fever or abnormal discharge.

What often happens after abdominal surgery is that the muscles and tissues need some time to recover, which can lead to lingering soreness. Emotional ups and downs can also be part of the healing process.

For now, gentle movement, staying hydrated, and using pain medication as advised can help. If you notice any new or worsening symptoms—such as increasing pain, fever, redness or swelling at your incision, or trouble with bowel movements—those would be reasons to get checked sooner.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about your healing process, or if you'd like tips for managing discomfort at home.

**Patient**: Thanks, that actually makes me feel a bit better. I was getting worried since I've also been more tearful than usual—so it's good to know that's normal. If you have any tips for handling the soreness or the emotional stuff, I'd appreciate it.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 28-year-old female presenting for monitoring status post exploratory laparotomy. She reported mild lower abdominal cramping without vaginal bleeding, fever, or chills, and was found to have abdominal tenderness on exam. Her history is significant for type I diabetes mellitus (on insulin pump), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and hyperlipidemia. Imaging revealed a pregnancy in the left rudimentary horn of a bicornuate uterus with thinned myometrium, placing her at high risk for uterine rupture. The documented diagnosis was pregnancy in a rudimentary uterine horn. She underwent surgical excision of the left rudimentary horn and left salpingectomy, with pain managed by Toradol and dilaudid initially, and transitioned to ibuprofen and Percocet on discharge. Her insulin regimen was managed perioperatively, and her levothyroxine dose was adjusted to pre-pregnancy levels. She was discharged home in stable condition with instructions for follow-up with gynecology and endocrinology.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with lower abdominal cramping following recent surgery. The cramping has been steady since the procedure, is described as uncomfortable but not severe, and is associated with localized tenderness to palpation. There are no accompanying symptoms such as fever, changes in bowel movements, or abnormal discharge; the patient reports normal eating, drinking, and digestion. The discomfort affects daily activities somewhat and has led to increased tearfulness, but the patient remains able to function. Pain medication provides partial relief. The clinical impression is that the patient’s recovery is generally on track, with mild abdominal discomfort and emotional changes considered common during postoperative healing. The treatment plan includes continued gentle movement, hydration, and use of pain medication as needed, with instructions to seek care if symptoms worsen or new signs of infection develop.
