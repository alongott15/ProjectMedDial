## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.900
- **Justification**: The dialogue is realistic and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, open-ended and symptom-focused questions, and the patient provides plausible, relevant responses. The conversation follows a logical clinical reasoning process for a sore throat with associated symptoms. The only issue is the abrupt end due to a simulation error, not a content or realism problem.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Continue providing clear, relevant answers to the doctor's questions. Ensure responses are complete and avoid simulation errors or incomplete turns.

**Doctor Side**: Excellent job eliciting relevant history and clarifying symptom details. Consider asking about airway symptoms (e.g., difficulty breathing, drooling) earlier given the swelling and tenderness.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is natural and logical. The abrupt end was due to a technical issue, not conversational structure. Ensure the simulation allows for completion of the exchange.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns in the dialogue itself. The doctor appropriately explores red flag symptoms. Ensure the simulation allows for full assessment and does not cut off before critical information is gathered.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me what’s been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I’ve been dealing with a sore throat that just won’t go away. That’s really what brought me in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask—how much is this affecting your day-to-day life? Are you able to eat, talk, and sleep normally, or is it making those things difficult?

**Patient**: It's definitely making things harder. Eating and talking are both uncomfortable, and I’ve had some trouble sleeping because of the soreness.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when this all began—how long have you been dealing with the sore throat? Has it been staying about the same, getting better, or getting worse over time?

**Patient**: I've had this sore throat for several days now. It feels like it's getting a bit worse, not better.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed any fever, body aches, or just feeling generally unwell along with your sore throat?

**Patient**: I’ve felt pretty run down—just a general sense of malaise. I’ve also had some pain when swallowing. I think I’ve had some fevers, but I haven’t checked my temperature.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something that can sometimes go along with a sore throat—have you noticed any swelling or tenderness in your neck, especially on one side?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve noticed some swelling and tenderness on the left side of my neck. It’s been pretty uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you swallow, does the pain shoot into your ear or get significantly worse, or is it mostly just in your throat and neck? This helps me understand how much irritation or inflammation there might be.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 59-year-old man presenting with a two-day history of sore throat, malaise, odynophagia, and left neck swelling and tenderness. He reported subjective fevers, hoarseness, and recent sick contact with his wife who had an upper respiratory infection; he denied recent dental work or prior neck swelling. His past medical history includes non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, with no known drug allergies. Physical examination revealed left soft palate swelling with uvular deviation, a tender enlarged left submandibular gland, and fiberoptic endoscopy showed significant left-sided pharyngeal wall swelling compromising the airway. Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis (WBC 28.5) and hyperglycemia (glucose 185). Neck CT demonstrated a left parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal space phlegmon without abscess. The documented diagnosis was left parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal phlegmon/cellulitis. Treatment included ICU observation for airway compromise, intravenous Unasyn and Decadron, followed by discharge on a ten-day course of Augmentin XR and continuation of home antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications.
