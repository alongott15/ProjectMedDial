## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks logical, stepwise questions about the patient's symptoms, focusing on nausea, chest pain, shortness of breath, and facial swelling—all of which are present in the profile. The reasoning about possible angina and parotid gland involvement is appropriate given the symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments introduced. The conversation is clear, respectful, and avoids role confusion.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and appropriately volunteers information when prompted. To improve realism, the patient could occasionally express uncertainty or ask clarifying questions about medical terms.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and explains their thought process well. For further realism, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's cardiac history more explicitly when discussing angina, and mention plans for further evaluation or monitoring.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and smooth, with each question building on prior answers. The summary and explanation at the end are helpful. To enhance realism, a brief closing statement about next steps or reassurance could be added.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns are present. The explanations are clear and appropriate for a light case simulation. The doctor avoids making definitive diagnoses or recommending treatments without further evaluation.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've mostly been feeling pretty nauseous lately. That's the main thing that's bothering me right now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your nausea—when did you first start noticing it, and is it there all the time or does it come and go?

**Patient**: I can't remember exactly when it started, but the nausea seems to come and go throughout the day. It’s been more noticeable lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you had any chest discomfort or trouble catching your breath along with the nausea?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve had some chest pain and it does feel harder to breathe at times, especially when the nausea is bad.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your breathing—when you feel short of breath, is it more like you can't get enough air, or do you feel tightness or pressure in your chest?

**Patient**: It feels more like a pressure in my chest, not so much like I can’t get enough air. The tightness usually comes along with the nausea.

**Doctor**: Alright. Does physical activity, like walking or climbing stairs, seem to bring on the chest pressure or make your breathing more difficult, or does it happen even when you're resting?

**Patient**: Physical activity definitely makes it worse. If I walk or go up stairs, the chest pressure and breathing trouble get more noticeable. It can also happen when I’m resting, but activity brings it on more.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you lie down to rest, does the chest pressure or breathing difficulty get better, worse, or stay about the same?

**Patient**: Resting usually helps a bit. The chest pressure and breathing get a little better when I lie down.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more thing—have you noticed any sweating, lightheadedness, or feeling faint when these episodes happen? This helps me understand if there could be any underlying heart or circulation issues.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any sweating, lightheadedness, or felt faint when these episodes happen. It’s mainly just the nausea, chest pain, and shortness of breath.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something related—have you noticed any swelling in your face, particularly on one side, or any changes in how your face looks or feels? This can sometimes help us narrow down possible causes.

**Patient**: Yes, I've noticed some swelling on the left side of my face, and that area feels tender, especially around the parotid gland.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your main concerns are nausea, chest pressure that worsens with activity, occasional breathing difficulty, and now swelling and tenderness on the left side of your face near the parotid gland. These symptoms can sometimes be related, but the facial swelling and tenderness suggest there could be an issue with your salivary gland—such as inflammation or infection—which can cause discomfort and even contribute to nausea.

The chest pressure and shortness of breath that get worse with activity are important to pay attention to, especially given your age. Sometimes, these symptoms can be due to the heart not getting enough oxygen during exertion (known as angina), but they can also be caused by other conditions. The fact that you don’t have sweating or lightheadedness is somewhat reassuring, but it's still important to monitor.

Let me ask—when did you first notice the swelling and tenderness on your face? And has it been getting better, worse, or staying the same? This will help me understand how urgent this part of your symptoms might be.

**Patient**: I first noticed the swelling and tenderness a few days ago, and it’s been about the same since then—not really better or worse. Thank you for explaining everything, that helps me understand what might be going on.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 76-year-old female presenting with nausea, which serves as her anginal equivalent. She reported chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea upon arrival to the emergency room. Her medical history is significant for coronary artery disease with prior mid-LAD stenosis, diffuse left circumflex and RCA disease, hypertension, GERD, Billroth II surgery, anemia, hyperlipidemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and prior hysterectomy and appendectomy. Cardiac catheterization revealed significant multi-vessel coronary artery disease, including a 60% distal LAD lesion, 90% OM1 lesion, 70% OM2 lesion, and 80% mid-RCA lesion. She was diagnosed with a non-Q wave myocardial infarction. During the procedure, she continued to experience angina, which resolved after placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and she was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting. Prior to admission, her medications included Lipitor, pantoprazole, Creon, metoprolol, folic acid, nitroglycerin drip, Isordil, hydrochlorothiazide, Nexium, Altace, Coreg, and Plavix.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with nausea as the chief complaint. She reported intermittent nausea that has become more noticeable recently, along with chest pain described as pressure and occasional shortness of breath, especially when the nausea is worse. The chest pressure and breathing difficulty are aggravated by physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs, but can also occur at rest and improve somewhat with lying down; she denied associated sweating, lightheadedness, or feeling faint. Additionally, she noted swelling and tenderness on the left side of her face near the parotid gland, which started a few days ago and has remained unchanged. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. On assessment, the doctor noted that the facial swelling and tenderness may indicate a salivary gland issue (such as inflammation or infection), while the chest pressure and exertional shortness of breath could suggest angina or another condition, though absence of other symptoms was reassuring. The doctor emphasized the importance of monitoring these symptoms and explained possible causes to the patient.
