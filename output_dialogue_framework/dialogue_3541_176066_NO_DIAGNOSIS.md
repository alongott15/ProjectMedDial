## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the pain, associated symptoms, and relevant history (injuries, dental work, infections). The reasoning about possible nerve involvement is supported by the patient's symptoms (facial pain, diplopia, unsteady gait) and history (post-craniotomy for meningioma). The doctor gives clear safety advice and recommends timely evaluation without introducing unsupported diagnoses or treatments. The patient responds appropriately and seeks clarification.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could specify the duration of symptoms more precisely if possible.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's questioning and explanations are thorough and appropriate. To improve, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's surgical history earlier in the conversation to show awareness of its relevance.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical, with each question building on previous answers. The summary and safety advice are well-placed. Consider a brief recap of the patient's surgical history for completeness.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate for the symptoms described. No major concerns; the recommendation for prompt evaluation is justified.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it’s good to see you today. What’s been bothering you the most recently?

**Patient**: I've been having pain on the left side of my face, kind of around my cheek and under my eye. That's what's been bothering me most.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain—when did this first start, and has it been constant or does it come and go?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly when it started, but it's been bothering me for a little while now. The pain kind of comes and goes, not always constant.

**Doctor**: Alright. Besides the discomfort you've mentioned, have you noticed any other symptoms—like congestion, changes in vision, or any numbness or tingling?

**Patient**: I have noticed some double vision lately, and I feel a bit unsteady when I walk. I haven't had any congestion or numbness.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your balance—when you feel unsteady, is it more like the room is spinning, or do you just feel off-balance? And does the double vision happen all the time or only when you look in certain directions?

**Patient**: I just feel off-balance, not like the room is spinning. The double vision isn't there all the time—it's more noticeable when I look in certain directions.

**Doctor**: Got it. How would you describe the pain—would you say it’s sharp, dull, throbbing, or something else? And does anything in particular seem to trigger or worsen it?

**Patient**: The pain feels more sharp than dull, mostly around my left cheek and under my eye. I haven't noticed anything specific that makes it worse. The double vision is still the main thing along with the pain.

**Doctor**: Got it. How severe would you say the pain is, on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine?

**Patient**: I’d rate the pain around a 6 out of 10. It’s uncomfortable, but not unbearable.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you had any recent injuries, dental work, or infections around your face or teeth that might be related to what you’re experiencing?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any injuries, dental work, or infections around my face or teeth recently.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your vision—when you notice the double vision, does closing one eye make it go away? This helps me understand if both eyes are involved or just one.

**Patient**: Yes, closing one eye makes the double vision go away. So it seems like both eyes are involved when I see double.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms of sharp facial pain, double vision that goes away when you close one eye, and feeling unsteady when walking suggest that there may be an issue affecting the nerves or muscles around your left eye. Double vision that improves with one eye closed often points to a problem with how the eyes are working together—sometimes related to the muscles or nerves controlling eye movement.

While facial pain can sometimes be caused by sinus issues or dental problems, the combination with double vision and balance concerns makes me think more about possible nerve involvement. This isn't usually caused by something minor like a sinus infection, especially since you haven't had congestion or recent dental work.

At this point, I recommend you have a more thorough evaluation soon—ideally within the next day or two. These symptoms aren't typically caused by something simple and could represent a nerve issue that needs to be checked. In the meantime, if you develop weakness in your arms or legs, trouble speaking or swallowing, severe headache, or vision loss, seek medical attention immediately.

Would you like guidance on how to arrange a prompt evaluation, or do you have any questions about what we've discussed so far?

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I understand why you want me to get checked out soon. I’d appreciate some guidance on arranging an evaluation—should I contact my regular doctor or go somewhere else?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 58-year-old male presenting with chronic left infraorbital and cheek pain, described as facial pain persisting for 3-4 years, partially relieved by Tegretol. Imaging revealed a left petrous sphenoid meningioma compressing the brainstem, but he had no neurological deficits, seizures, incontinence, or falls prior to surgery. Relevant history includes long-standing facial pain and use of Tegretol for symptom management; no medication allergies are specified. Preoperative laboratory values were within normal limits, and intraoperative and postoperative courses were stable except for a transient drop in platelet count, managed with a transfusion. The documented diagnosis was status post craniotomy for excision of meningioma. Postoperatively, he experienced diplopia that resolved before discharge and had a slightly unsteady gait, for which he was provided a cane. Physical and occupational therapy evaluations were performed, and follow-up therapy was arranged for home. He was advised not to walk unassisted due to his gait instability.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with pain on the left side of the face, specifically around the cheek and under the eye. The pain has been present for a while, comes and goes, is described as sharp, and is rated 6 out of 10 in severity; no specific triggers were identified. Additional symptoms include intermittent double vision, which is more noticeable when looking in certain directions and resolves when one eye is closed, as well as feeling off-balance when walking; no congestion, numbness, recent injuries, dental work, or infections were reported. The patient denied any history of facial trauma or dental procedures. On clinical assessment, the doctor noted the combination of sharp facial pain, binocular double vision, and unsteadiness, suggesting possible nerve or muscle involvement around the left eye rather than sinus or dental causes. The doctor recommended a prompt and thorough evaluation within the next day or two due to concern for a nerve issue. The patient was advised to seek immediate medical attention if new symptoms such as limb weakness, trouble speaking or swallowing, severe headache, or vision loss develop. Guidance on arranging an evaluation was offered.
