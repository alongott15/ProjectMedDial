## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the pain, associated symptoms, and relevant history (injuries, dental work, infections). The reasoning about possible nerve involvement is supported by the patient's symptoms (facial pain, diplopia, unsteady gait) and history (post-craniotomy for meningioma). The doctor gives clear safety advice and recommends timely evaluation without introducing unsupported diagnoses or treatments. The patient responds appropriately and seeks clarification.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could specify the duration of symptoms more precisely if possible.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's questioning and explanations are thorough and appropriate. To improve, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's surgical history earlier in the conversation to show awareness of its relevance.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical, with each question building on previous answers. The summary and safety advice are well-placed. Consider a brief recap of the patient's surgical history for completeness.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate for the symptoms described. No major concerns; the recommendation for prompt evaluation is justified.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it’s good to see you today. What’s been bothering you the most recently?

**Patient**: I've been having pain on the left side of my face, kind of around my cheek and under my eye. That's what's been bothering me most.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain—when did this first start, and has it been constant or does it come and go?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly when it started, but it's been bothering me for a little while now. The pain kind of comes and goes, not always constant.

**Doctor**: Alright. Besides the discomfort you've mentioned, have you noticed any other symptoms—like congestion, changes in vision, or any numbness or tingling?

**Patient**: I have noticed some double vision lately, and I feel a bit unsteady when I walk. I haven't had any congestion or numbness.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your balance—when you feel unsteady, is it more like the room is spinning, or do you just feel off-balance? And does the double vision happen all the time or only when you look in certain directions?

**Patient**: I just feel off-balance, not like the room is spinning. The double vision isn't there all the time—it's more noticeable when I look in certain directions.

**Doctor**: Got it. How would you describe the pain—would you say it’s sharp, dull, throbbing, or something else? And does anything in particular seem to trigger or worsen it?

**Patient**: The pain feels more sharp than dull, mostly around my left cheek and under my eye. I haven't noticed anything specific that makes it worse. The double vision is still the main thing along with the pain.

**Doctor**: Got it. How severe would you say the pain is, on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine?

**Patient**: I’d rate the pain around a 6 out of 10. It’s uncomfortable, but not unbearable.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you had any recent injuries, dental work, or infections around your face or teeth that might be related to what you’re experiencing?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any injuries, dental work, or infections around my face or teeth recently.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your vision—when you notice the double vision, does closing one eye make it go away? This helps me understand if both eyes are involved or just one.

**Patient**: Yes, closing one eye makes the double vision go away. So it seems like both eyes are involved when I see double.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms of sharp facial pain, double vision that goes away when you close one eye, and feeling unsteady when walking suggest that there may be an issue affecting the nerves or muscles around your left eye. Double vision that improves with one eye closed often points to a problem with how the eyes are working together—sometimes related to the muscles or nerves controlling eye movement.

While facial pain can sometimes be caused by sinus issues or dental problems, the combination with double vision and balance concerns makes me think more about possible nerve involvement. This isn't usually caused by something minor like a sinus infection, especially since you haven't had congestion or recent dental work.

At this point, I recommend you have a more thorough evaluation soon—ideally within the next day or two. These symptoms aren't typically caused by something simple and could represent a nerve issue that needs to be checked. In the meantime, if you develop weakness in your arms or legs, trouble speaking or swallowing, severe headache, or vision loss, seek medical attention immediately.

Would you like guidance on how to arrange a prompt evaluation, or do you have any questions about what we've discussed so far?

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I understand why you want me to get checked out soon. I’d appreciate some guidance on arranging an evaluation—should I contact my regular doctor or go somewhere else?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 58-year-old male presenting with chronic left infraorbital and cheek pain, described as facial pain persisting for 3-4 years, partially relieved by Tegretol. He had no neurological deficits, seizures, incontinence, or falls prior to admission. Imaging revealed a left petrous sphenoid meningioma compressing the brain stem. The documented diagnosis was status post craniotomy for excision of meningioma. He underwent a left presigmoid occipital craniotomy for tumor removal, with an unremarkable intraoperative course and stable pre- and postoperative condition. Postoperatively, he experienced transient diplopia that resolved before discharge and had a slightly unsteady gait, for which he was provided a cane and referred for physical and occupational therapy follow-up. He received one unit of platelets postoperatively due to a transient drop in platelet count. Discharge instructions included assisted ambulation at home, staple removal prior to follow-up, and continued therapy, with his wife available for support.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with left-sided facial pain as the chief complaint. The pain is described as sharp, rated 6 out of 10 in severity, located around the left cheek and under the eye, and has been present for an unspecified duration with intermittent episodes. Additional symptoms include intermittent double vision that resolves when one eye is closed and a sensation of being off-balance when walking; there is no associated congestion, numbness, recent injury, dental work, or infection. The double vision occurs primarily in certain directions of gaze and suggests involvement of both eyes. The clinical impression is that these symptoms may indicate a problem affecting the nerves or muscles controlling eye movement, rather than a minor issue such as sinusitis or dental pathology. No formal diagnosis was documented, but possible nerve involvement was discussed. The treatment plan includes arranging a prompt evaluation within the next day or two and instructions to seek immediate medical attention if new neurological symptoms develop. Guidance on arranging further evaluation was offered.
