## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: UNREALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.500
- **Justification**: The dialogue is generally plausible in its structure and tone, but it contains a significant clinical oversight: the doctor concludes the pain is most likely musculoskeletal and provides reassurance and conservative management without addressing the patient's history of coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and recent syncope (passing out). These are red flags that should prompt a more urgent cardiac or vascular evaluation, not just reassurance. The patient's mention of lightheadedness and syncope comes only after the doctor has already concluded the assessment, which is not realistic given that these symptoms are present in the profile and should have been elicited earlier. The dialogue also omits discussion of bilateral lower extremity claudication and mild lower back pain, which are relevant to the patient's vascular history.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient should mention all relevant symptoms earlier, especially lightheadedness and syncope, as these are significant and would likely be volunteered sooner in a real encounter.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor should inquire about and address the patient's history of syncope, lightheadedness, and vascular disease early in the assessment. Given the cardiac history and concerning symptoms, a more thorough evaluation for cardiac or vascular causes is warranted before concluding musculoskeletal pain.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is generally logical, but it misses critical information gathering. The conversation should integrate all relevant symptoms and risk factors before reaching a conclusion.

**Safety Or Clarity**: There is a safety concern: the dialogue underestimates the risk of serious cardiac or vascular pathology in a high-risk patient with concerning symptoms. The explanation and plan should be more cautious, with clear instructions for urgent evaluation if warranted.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me about any discomfort or symptoms you've been experiencing lately?

**Patient**: I've been having this steady, dull pain just behind my left shoulder blade, and it sometimes spreads to my left shoulder and arm.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first notice this pain, and has it been constant since it began or does it come and go?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it started, but the pain has been pretty steady since I first noticed it.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything you do—like certain movements, positions, or activities—seem to make the discomfort better or worse?

**Patient**: Nothing specific seems to make it better or worse. It just stays about the same no matter what I do.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arm or hand along with this discomfort?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any numbness, tingling, or weakness in my arm or hand. It's mainly just the pain.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you had any shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or sweating along with this?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or sweating. The pain is mainly in my left shoulder, behind the scapula, and sometimes in my left shoulder area.

**Doctor**: Alright. How would you rate the intensity of this pain on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine?

**Patient**: I'd rate the pain around a 6 out of 10. It's definitely uncomfortable, but not the worst pain I've ever felt.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your daily activities—has this discomfort made it harder for you to do things like reaching, lifting, or sleeping comfortably?

**Patient**: Yes, it's made things like reaching or lifting a bit more uncomfortable, and sleeping hasn't been as easy lately because of the pain.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall health—have you had any recent injuries, heavy lifting, or new physical activities that might have strained your upper back or shoulder area?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any recent injuries or done any heavy lifting or new activities that would have strained my back or shoulder.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms sound most consistent with a musculoskeletal issue, such as a muscle strain or irritation around the shoulder blade area. This is especially likely since the discomfort is steady, hasn't changed with activity or rest, and isn't accompanied by neurological symptoms like numbness or weakness. It's also reassuring that you haven't had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms.

What often happens with this type of pain is that posture, minor overuse, or even sleeping in an awkward position can irritate the muscles or soft tissues in that region. These pains can linger and be quite uncomfortable, but they usually improve with time.

For now, gentle stretching, applying a warm compress, and avoiding activities that aggravate the area can help. Over-the-counter pain relief like acetaminophen or ibuprofen (if you have no allergies or contraindications) can also be useful.

If you notice any new symptoms—such as severe pain, weakness, numbness, chest symptoms, or if the pain gets much worse—those would be reasons to seek prompt evaluation. Otherwise, this type of discomfort often improves within a week or two.

Does this explanation make sense, or is there anything else about your symptoms you'd like to discuss?

**Patient**: That makes sense, thank you for explaining. I did want to mention that I’ve also been feeling a bit lightheaded, and I actually passed out while sitting in a chair recently. Should I be concerned about that along with the pain?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 56-year-old female presenting with left scapular pain radiating to the left shoulder and arm, with recurrence of pain and an episode of syncope after taking sublingual nitroglycerin. The pain was described as dull and steady, lasting two days initially, with partial relief from nitroglycerin and no associated dyspnea, nausea, or diaphoresis; a second episode occurred after dinner, again partially relieved by nitroglycerin but followed by lightheadedness and syncope. Her relevant history includes known coronary artery disease with recent right coronary artery stenting, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and right knee surgery; she takes Lopressor, Lipitor, Lisinopril, Plavix, Aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed. Cardiac catheterization during this admission showed patent right coronary artery stents and no significant change in coronary anatomy compared to four days prior. The documented diagnoses were left shoulder pain (with acute stent thrombosis ruled out), known coronary artery disease with patent stent, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, questionable COPD, and history of right knee surgery. Treatment included continuation of her cardiac medications, intravenous fluids, anticoagulation during evaluation, and Tylenol #3 for musculoskeletal shoulder pain. She was advised to lay down before taking sublingual nitroglycerin in the future. The patient was discharged in stable condition with follow-up arranged with her cardiologist.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with a chief complaint of steady, dull pain behind the left shoulder blade, radiating to the left shoulder and arm. The pain has been constant since onset, rated 6 out of 10 in intensity, and is not affected by movement, position, or activity. There are no associated neurological symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness) or cardiopulmonary symptoms (shortness of breath, chest discomfort, sweating). The discomfort has made reaching, lifting, and sleeping more difficult, but there is no history of recent injury or unusual physical activity. The clinical impression documented by the doctor is a musculoskeletal issue, likely muscle strain or irritation around the shoulder blade. The treatment plan includes gentle stretching, warm compresses, avoiding aggravating activities, and over-the-counter pain relief such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen if there are no contraindications. The patient was advised to seek prompt evaluation if severe pain, neurological symptoms, or chest symptoms develop. Additionally, the patient reported recent lightheadedness and a syncopal episode (fainting while sitting), which was raised as a new concern at the end of the visit.
