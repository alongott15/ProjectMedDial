## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the chest pain, its characteristics, associated symptoms, and aggravating/relieving factors. The patient responses align with the documented symptoms and history. The doctor's reasoning is sound, prioritizing cardiac causes given the patient's age and risk factors, and the recommendation for urgent in-person evaluation is appropriate. There are no unsupported diagnoses or treatments introduced. The patient also brings up relevant additional symptoms (leg swelling, incision drainage) at the end, which fits the postoperative context.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and appropriately volunteers new symptoms at the end. For even greater realism, the patient could mention the leg swelling and incision drainage earlier or in response to a direct question about other symptoms.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For completeness, the doctor could have asked earlier about recent surgeries or procedures, given the patient's complex history, or specifically inquired about leg swelling or wound issues.

**Conversation Flow**: The dialogue flows logically from symptom exploration to assessment and plan. The addition of new symptoms at the end is realistic but could be integrated earlier for smoother flow.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The safety advice is clear and appropriate. The doctor avoids unsupported reassurance and emphasizes the need for urgent evaluation. No safety concerns noted.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about any discomfort or symptoms you've been experiencing lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some chest pain lately, and it’s made me pretty anxious. That’s really why I’m here today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed this discomfort—has it been going on for days, weeks, or longer?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think the chest pain started a few days ago. It kind of came on suddenly and hasn't really gone away.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain itself—does it feel sharp, dull, pressure-like, or something else? And does it ever move to your shoulder blades or down your arms?

**Patient**: The pain mostly feels like pressure, and it does go across my shoulder blades and down my arms sometimes. It’s not really sharp, just uncomfortable and worrisome.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed your heart beating faster than usual, or any episodes of palpitations along with this discomfort?

**Patient**: Yes, I have noticed my heart beating faster than usual at times. It can be a bit unsettling when it happens along with the chest pain.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if the discomfort or the faster heartbeat happens more with activity, like walking or climbing stairs, or does it come on even when you're resting?

**Patient**: The discomfort and the faster heartbeat seem to happen both when I’m moving around and sometimes even when I’m just sitting still. There isn’t always a clear pattern to it.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you felt any shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or sweating when these episodes happen? Sometimes those symptoms can help us understand what’s going on.

**Patient**: I haven’t really had any shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or sweating with these episodes. The main things have been the chest pain, the pressure across my shoulders and arms, and the fast heartbeat.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how intense this discomfort gets—on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you can imagine, where would you rate it when it’s at its worst?

**Patient**: When it’s at its worst, I’d rate the pain around a 7 out of 10. It’s definitely uncomfortable, but not the worst pain I’ve ever had.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything seem to make these episodes better or worse—like resting, changing positions, eating, or taking deep breaths?

**Patient**: Resting helps a bit, but the pain doesn’t completely go away. Changing positions or taking deep breaths doesn’t seem to make much difference.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re experiencing a persistent pressure sensation that sometimes radiates, along with episodes of a faster heartbeat. While you haven’t noticed shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness—which are reassuring—your age and the nature of your symptoms do make me think carefully about possible underlying causes.

Often, chest discomfort with these features can be related to heart or musculoskeletal issues, but because you mention the sensation sometimes spreads and is accompanied by palpitations, I want to make sure we don’t overlook anything important. Sometimes, anxiety can contribute to similar sensations, but it’s always safest to rule out cardiac causes first, especially in someone your age.

At this point, I’d recommend that you get checked in-person soon—ideally today—to make sure your heart is healthy. This would usually involve an EKG and possibly some basic blood work. While many causes of chest pressure are not dangerous, some can be, and it’s best not to take chances.

While waiting, if you notice any new symptoms like severe shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, or if the discomfort becomes much more intense or constant, seek emergency care right away.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about what I’ve explained, or if there’s anything else you’d like to discuss about your symptoms.

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll make sure to get checked out today like you suggested. I also wanted to mention that I’ve noticed a bit of swelling in both my legs, and there’s a small amount of reddish fluid coming from the top part of my left leg incision.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 74-year-old woman presenting with chest pain. She experienced three days of chest pain radiating across her shoulder blades and down her arms, lasting one to 1.5 hours, worse at night when lying down, and not fully relieved by heparin or nitroglycerin. Her history is significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) with prior myocardial infarction, LAD stent placement, COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and left bundle branch block; she has no known allergies. The documented diagnosis was CAD, status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) times four, along with COPD, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, and left bundle branch block. She underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD and saphenous vein grafts to OM2, diag, and OM1, tolerated the procedure well, and required temporary pacing postoperatively due to heart block. Her postoperative course included gradual weaning from ventilatory and inotropic support, initiation of metoprolol for tachycardia, and physical rehabilitation. At discharge, she was stable on medications including Lasix, potassium chloride, aspirin, Plavix, pravastatin, metoprolol, enalapril, Percocet, and albuterol. She was discharged to rehabilitation with follow-up arranged with her primary care provider and cardiologist.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with chest pain as the chief complaint. The chest pain began a few days ago, is described as a pressure sensation rated 7 out of 10 at its worst, and sometimes radiates across the shoulder blades and down the arms; episodes are accompanied by palpitations and occur both at rest and with activity. The patient denies associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or sweating, and notes that resting provides some relief, though the pain does not fully resolve. There is also reported swelling in both legs and a small amount of reddish fluid from a left leg incision. Relevant medical history, medications, and allergies are not specified in the dialogue. The clinical impression includes concern for possible cardiac causes given the nature and radiation of the pain, though anxiety and musculoskeletal etiologies are also considered. The physician recommends urgent in-person evaluation with EKG and basic blood work to rule out cardiac causes. The patient is advised to seek emergency care if new or worsening symptoms such as severe shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, or increased pain occur.
