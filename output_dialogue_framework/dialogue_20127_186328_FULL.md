## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate follow-up questions about the patient's symptoms (confusion, agitation, tachycardia, fever) and medication changes, and the patient provides relevant, coherent answers. The doctor's explanation about withdrawal symptoms from Ativan and reassurance is medically reasonable given the context. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers. For even greater realism, the patient could occasionally express uncertainty or ask clarifying questions about medical terms (e.g., 'What is Ativan for again?').

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and clear. To enhance realism, the doctor could briefly check for other common post-op issues (e.g., appetite, mobility) or mention coordination with the surgical team.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good back-and-forth. The conversation could be slightly more concise in places, but overall it maintains engagement and clarity.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The doctor provides clear instructions on when to seek further care and checks for understanding at the end.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I came in because they couldn't finish my last colonoscopy—there was a large growth, I think they called it an adenoma. They said I'd need surgery, and I've just been feeling a bit off lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the feeling of being a bit off—when did you first start noticing this, and can you describe exactly what feels different for you?

**Patient**: I noticed some mild confusion, maybe a few days after the surgery. Things just seemed a little foggy, and I wasn't quite myself.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other changes—have you noticed feeling unusually restless or agitated, or has your heart seemed to beat faster than usual since the surgery?

**Patient**: Yes, I have felt more agitated than usual, and my heart has been beating faster at times. It's been noticeable especially when they've tried to lower my medication.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about when the restlessness and faster heartbeat tend to come on—does it happen at certain times of day, or in response to anything specific, like changes in your medication or activity level?

**Patient**: The increased heart rate and agitation seemed to get worse when they tried to wean me off ativan. I also had a bit of a fever around that time, but I don't remember it happening at any specific time of day.

**Doctor**: Got it. When your heart races or you feel more agitated, do you also notice any other symptoms—like sweating, shaking, or trouble sleeping?

**Patient**: I haven't really noticed sweating or shaking. Trouble sleeping hasn't been a big issue for me either. My mind felt much clearer by the ninth day after surgery.

**Doctor**: Alright. When they tried to lower your ativan, did you notice the faster heartbeat coming on suddenly, or did it build up gradually over time?

**Patient**: It seemed to come on gradually, not all at once. The faster heartbeat and agitation got worse as they reduced the ativan.

**Doctor**: I see. When your heart rate increases, have you ever felt lightheaded or like you might faint, or has it mostly just been a sensation of your heart beating faster?

**Patient**: No, I haven't felt lightheaded or like I might faint. It's mostly just been my heart beating faster and feeling more agitated.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall recovery—aside from the heart rate and agitation, have you been able to get back to your usual activities since the surgery, or has anything else made daily life more difficult?

**Patient**: I've been able to get back to most of my usual activities since my mental status cleared up after the ninth day. Nothing else has really made daily life more difficult, apart from what we've talked about.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like the increased heart rate and agitation were most noticeable during attempts to reduce your ativan after surgery, and these symptoms gradually improved as your mental clarity returned. This pattern suggests your body may have been adjusting to changes in the medication, which is not uncommon—especially after being on medications like ativan (a benzodiazepine), which can sometimes lead to withdrawal symptoms if reduced too quickly. These symptoms can include agitation, faster heartbeat, and mild confusion.

The fact that your symptoms improved as time went on and that you're back to your usual activities is reassuring. What often happens in cases like this is the body needs some time to adjust after surgery and medication changes. It's good that you haven't experienced more severe symptoms like fainting or ongoing sleep trouble.

If you ever notice your heart racing persistently, severe confusion, or new symptoms like chest pain or trouble breathing, those would be reasons to seek care promptly. For now, staying active, keeping hydrated, and following up with your care team about any further medication adjustments are all helpful steps. Does that explanation make sense, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss about your recovery?

**Patient**: That explanation makes sense to me, thank you. I'm glad to hear that what I went through is pretty typical after changing medications. If anything new comes up, I’ll let the team know.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 76-year-old male presenting for management of a large adenoma at the hepatic flexure discovered during an incomplete surveillance colonoscopy. He was asymptomatic prior to admission, with the primary issue being the inability to complete polypectomy due to the size and location of the adenoma. Relevant history includes diabetes mellitus, prior prostatectomy, artificial urinary sphincter, agoraphobia, osteoarthritis, alcohol use, and a sulfa allergy; home medication is Celexa. On physical exam, he was alert and oriented, in no acute distress, with normal cardiac and pulmonary findings, a reducible left inguinal hernia, and no abdominal tenderness or rectal mass. The patient underwent an extended right colectomy (initially laparoscopic, converted to open). Postoperatively, he experienced mild confusion and later agitation, prompting initiation of CIWA protocol and Ativan for delirium tremens prophylaxis due to significant alcohol history. He also required magnesium supplementation for hypomagnesemia. Pain was managed with morphine PCA, and he was initially kept NPO.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with concerns following an incomplete colonoscopy due to a large adenoma and subsequent surgery, reporting feeling "a bit off" postoperatively. Symptoms included mild confusion starting a few days after surgery, increased agitation, and episodes of faster heart rate, particularly during attempts to wean off ativan; these symptoms worsened gradually with medication reduction and were accompanied by a brief fever but no sweating, shaking, trouble sleeping, lightheadedness, or fainting. The patient noted that mental clarity returned by the ninth day after surgery and was able to resume usual activities without further difficulty. Relevant history includes recent surgery for adenoma and use of ativan, with withdrawal symptoms noted during medication tapering; no other medical history or allergies were mentioned. The doctor assessed that the agitation and tachycardia were likely related to benzodiazepine (ativan) withdrawal following surgery, which can commonly cause such symptoms. Physical findings were limited to patient-reported symptoms; no abnormal exam findings were described. The doctor advised monitoring for persistent tachycardia, severe confusion, chest pain, or breathing difficulties and recommended staying active, hydrated, and maintaining communication with the care team regarding further medication adjustments. The patient expressed understanding of the explanation and agreed to follow up if new symptoms arise.
