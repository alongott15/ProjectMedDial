## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks logical, stepwise questions about the exertional chest pain, associated symptoms, and functional impact. The patient responses are plausible and align with the known diagnoses (aortic stenosis, angina, etc.). The doctor summarizes the findings, provides appropriate safety advice, and recommends follow-up without introducing unsupported diagnoses or interventions. There are no hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any recent changes in medication or other health events if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and clear. For completeness, the doctor could briefly check for red flag symptoms (e.g., chest pain at rest, palpitations, syncope) more explicitly or ask about medication adherence.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between topics. The closing is supportive and open-ended.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate for a light case. The doctor correctly emphasizes when to seek urgent care. Clarity is high throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: My chest has been hurting when I walk or do anything active. It's made me a bit worried lately.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed this discomfort—how long has this been going on?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been going on for a couple of weeks now. It seems to happen more when I'm moving around.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—when you feel this discomfort during activity, do you also notice any shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or sweating?

**Patient**: Yes, I do get short of breath when the chest pain comes on. Sometimes I feel a bit dizzy too.

**Doctor**: Alright. How much does this discomfort limit what you can do day-to-day—are there activities you've had to stop or avoid because of it?

**Patient**: I've had to slow down quite a bit. Even just walking around the house or going up the stairs makes me stop and catch my breath now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the discomfort itself—does it go away when you rest, or does it linger even after you stop moving?

**Patient**: It usually goes away once I sit down and rest for a bit. It doesn't really linger after I stop moving.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you feel this discomfort and need to rest, about how long does it take for the symptoms to fully resolve?

**Patient**: Usually after a few minutes of resting, the chest pain and shortness of breath go away. Sometimes I still feel a bit dizzy or even a little nauseous right after, but that fades too.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the quality of the discomfort—does it feel more like a pressure, tightness, sharp pain, or something else?

**Patient**: It feels more like a tightness or pressure in my chest, not really a sharp pain.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you ever felt these symptoms when you're resting, or do they only come on with physical activity?

**Patient**: No, the symptoms only come on when I'm active. I don't get them while I'm resting.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms—tightness in the chest, breathlessness, and dizziness that come on with exertion and improve with rest—can sometimes be seen in conditions where the heart isn't getting enough oxygen during activity. This is commonly called "angina," and it often means that the heart has to work harder during physical activity, causing discomfort until you rest.

It’s important to monitor for any changes—such as symptoms coming on at rest, lasting longer, or getting more intense. If that happens, or if you ever feel faint, break out in a cold sweat, or notice new symptoms, you should seek medical attention right away.

For now, I’d recommend taking it easy with physical activity and avoiding anything that brings on these symptoms. Let’s also discuss following up soon for further evaluation. There are treatments and tests that can help clarify what’s happening and keep you safe.

Do you have any questions or concerns about what we’ve talked about so far?

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining that. I appreciate you taking the time to go over everything with me. I’ll be careful and watch for any changes like you said. How soon should I come back for that follow-up?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 78-year-old female presenting with exertional angina, shortness of breath (SOB), and dizziness. She has a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and now reports angina and dyspnea on exertion (DOE). Her past medical history includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, GERD, osteoporosis, and recent fall, among other conditions; she is allergic to Lisinopril, Diovan, and latex. On physical exam, she was not in acute distress, had a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border, and positive carotid bruits; laboratory results showed mild anemia and thrombocytopenia. Cardiac catheterization revealed significant coronary artery disease and severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 cm². The documented diagnosis was severe aortic stenosis with associated angina and exertional symptoms. She underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a #19 CE Magna pericardial valve and repair of the coronary sinus. Postoperative care included monitoring labs and supportive management.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with chest discomfort during physical activity. Symptoms included chest tightness or pressure, shortness of breath, dizziness, and occasional mild nausea, all occurring with exertion and resolving within a few minutes of rest; the patient reported needing to slow down daily activities such as walking and climbing stairs due to these symptoms. No symptoms occurred at rest, and the discomfort did not linger after stopping activity. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. On clinical questioning, the patient described the chest discomfort as tightness or pressure rather than sharp pain, with associated breathlessness and dizziness during exertion. The doctor assessed that these symptoms are consistent with angina, suggesting the heart may not be getting enough oxygen during activity. The doctor advised the patient to avoid activities that trigger symptoms, monitor for any changes such as symptoms at rest or increased severity, and seek immediate medical attention if new or worsening symptoms occur. A follow-up was recommended for further evaluation and discussion of potential treatments and tests.
