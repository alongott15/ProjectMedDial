## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly realistic for a primary-care encounter with a patient who has a history of significant coronary artery disease and presents with intermittent chest pain. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the nature, timing, and associated symptoms of the chest pain, and summarizes the findings accurately. The explanation of possible causes and the safety advice are appropriate for a light case, given the patient's history. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The patient responses are plausible and consistent with the profile.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses understanding. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any recent changes in medications or lifestyle, or express specific concerns or anxieties about recurrence given their cardiac history.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and clear. For completeness, the doctor could briefly confirm medication adherence or ask about recent follow-up with cardiology, given the patient's complex cardiac history. A brief mention of reviewing current medications or risk factors would add depth.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between history-taking, summary, and education. The closing question invites further discussion, which is good practice.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate for a light case. The doctor appropriately advises on warning signs and when to seek urgent care. No safety concerns detected.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what's been going on?

**Patient**: I've been having this chest pain that comes and goes. Sometimes it happens when I'm active, but I've also felt it just sitting around. It's got me kind of worried.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the quality of the discomfort—would you describe it as sharp, pressure-like, burning, or something else?

**Patient**: It's more of a pressure feeling than sharp or burning. I notice it sort of tightens up, especially when I'm moving around, but sometimes even at rest.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when this all began—how long have you been noticing this pressure sensation in your chest?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it first started, but I think it's been going on for a couple of weeks now.

**Doctor**: Alright. Can you point to exactly where you feel the pressure in your chest? Is it more in the center, to one side, or does it move around?

**Patient**: It's mostly right in the center of my chest. I don't really notice it moving around or going to one side.

**Doctor**: Got it. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most intense discomfort you can imagine, how would you rate this pressure when it happens?

**Patient**: I'd rate the pressure around a 6, maybe a 7 at its worst. It's uncomfortable, but not unbearable.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—when you feel this chest pressure, do you ever notice shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or lightheadedness along with it?

**Patient**: I haven't noticed any sweating, nausea, or lightheadedness. I do get a bit short of breath sometimes, but that's something I've had before with my asthma.

**Doctor**: Okay. When the pressure comes on, does it usually last for just a few minutes, or does it stick around for longer stretches of time?

**Patient**: It usually lasts just a few minutes and then goes away. Sometimes it sticks around a bit longer, but it's not constant.

**Doctor**: Tell me more about what you’ve tried so far—does anything seem to relieve the pressure, like resting, changing position, or using your asthma inhaler? Or is there anything that tends to bring it on besides activity?

**Patient**: Resting does seem to help a bit when the pressure comes on. Using my asthma inhaler doesn't really make a difference for the chest pain itself. Besides activity, I haven't noticed anything specific that brings it on.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you're experiencing a central chest pressure that comes and goes, sometimes with activity and sometimes at rest, usually lasting a few minutes and relieved somewhat by rest. You haven't noticed sweating, nausea, or lightheadedness, and your asthma inhaler doesn't seem to impact the chest pressure.

Let me share my thoughts: chest discomfort can have a range of causes. In many cases, especially when it's a pressure sensation brought on by activity and relieved by rest, we consider the heart as a possible source. However, it can also be related to musculoskeletal strain, acid reflux, anxiety, or even sometimes asthma. The fact that your symptoms are intermittent and not associated with severe shortness of breath or other concerning symptoms is somewhat reassuring.

That said, because chest pain can sometimes signal something more serious—especially when it’s new or changing—I recommend you keep track of when it happens and what you’re doing at the time. If you develop symptoms like severe pain, pain that won’t go away, sweating, nausea, or feeling faint, those would be warning signs to seek immediate care.

For now, practical steps include avoiding activities that clearly bring on symptoms and monitoring for any changes. If the episodes become more frequent or intense, or if new symptoms develop, let’s get you evaluated more thoroughly.

Does this summary fit with what you’ve been experiencing? Is there anything else about these episodes that you’re concerned about or would like to discuss further?

**Patient**: Yes, that matches what I've been going through. Thanks for explaining it all clearly. I’ll keep track like you suggested—should I write down anything specific about each episode?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 45-year-old male presenting with intermittent chest pain occurring both with exercise and at rest. He was referred to cardiology after a positive stress test and cardiac catheterization revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease with normal ejection fraction. His past medical history includes asthma, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia; he has no known allergies and quit smoking in 2161. The documented diagnoses were coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) times three, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and asthma. The patient underwent CABG with LIMA to the LAD and saphenous vein grafts to the ramus and PDA2, tolerated the procedure well, and had an uncomplicated postoperative course. At discharge, he was stable, with clear breath sounds, regular heart rhythm, and clean incisions. Discharge medications included Niferex, Claritin, Singular, Advair, Albuterol, Ibuprofen, Lipitor, Niacin, Aspirin, Lopressor, Colace, Lasix (for seven days), potassium chloride (for seven days), and Percocet as needed. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks and cardiologist in four to six weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with intermittent central chest pressure as the chief complaint. The chest pressure has been occurring for a couple of weeks, is described as a 6–7/10 in intensity, and is more of a tightening or pressure sensation rather than sharp or burning. Symptoms are sometimes triggered by activity but can also occur at rest, typically last a few minutes, and are somewhat relieved by rest; there is no associated sweating, nausea, or lightheadedness, though mild shortness of breath is noted and attributed to a history of asthma. The patient reports that their asthma inhaler does not relieve the chest pressure. Relevant history includes asthma, with no mention of other medical conditions, medications, or allergies. The clinical impression is that the chest discomfort could be cardiac in origin but may also relate to musculoskeletal strain, acid reflux, anxiety, or asthma; no definitive diagnosis is documented. The treatment plan includes monitoring symptoms, avoiding activities that provoke discomfort, and seeking immediate care if severe or concerning symptoms develop; the patient is advised to keep a log of episodes and report any changes.
