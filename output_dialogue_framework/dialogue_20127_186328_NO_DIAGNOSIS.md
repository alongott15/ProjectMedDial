## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the patient's symptoms (confusion, agitation, tachycardia, fever) and their timing in relation to surgery and Ativan tapering. The patient responses are plausible and align with the documented history. The doctor's summary and advice are grounded in the context, with no unsupported diagnoses or recommendations. There are no hallucinations or major inconsistencies.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and appropriately expresses concerns. For even greater realism, occasional uncertainty or requests for clarification could be included.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. To further enhance realism, the doctor could briefly check for other common post-op complications (e.g., shortness of breath, chest pain) earlier in the conversation.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between topics. The conversation remains focused on the patient's main issues without unnecessary repetition.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The doctor gives clear explanations and appropriate follow-up advice.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What’s been on your mind lately, and how have you been feeling day to day?

**Patient**: I've been a bit concerned since the colonoscopy couldn’t be finished because of that large adenoma. Most days I’m just thinking about the upcoming surgery and hoping things go smoothly.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something else that can sometimes come up around this time—have you noticed any changes in your memory or thinking, like feeling more confused or agitated than usual? If so, when did that start?

**Patient**: I have noticed some mild confusion and agitation, especially after the surgery. I’m not sure exactly when it started, but it seemed to come and go for a bit.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something else—have you had any episodes of rapid heartbeat or fever since your surgery? Sometimes these can be important clues after a procedure.

**Patient**: Yes, I did have some episodes of rapid heartbeat and a fever after the surgery. The fast heart rate seemed to get worse when they tried to reduce my ativan.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—did the episodes of rapid heartbeat and fever happen right after surgery, or did they start later on? And how long did each episode tend to last?

**Patient**: It started later on, not right away after the surgery. I’m not sure about the exact length, but each episode seemed to last for a few days before things got better.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the rapid heartbeat—did you notice if it happened mostly when you were resting, moving around, or during certain times of day? Sometimes the pattern can help us understand what’s going on.

**Patient**: I mostly noticed the rapid heartbeat when I was resting. I don't remember it being tied to any particular time of day, though.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has the rapid heartbeat and confusion been improving over time, or have you noticed it staying about the same since those episodes started?

**Patient**: Yes, both the rapid heartbeat and confusion have improved. My mental status became clear around the ninth day after surgery, and my heart rate settled down after that as well.

**Doctor**: Got it. When they tried to reduce your Ativan, did you notice any other symptoms besides the rapid heartbeat—such as shaking, sweating, or trouble sleeping? Sometimes withdrawal from certain medications can cause a cluster of symptoms, and understanding this can help us manage things better in the future.

**Patient**: I didn’t really notice any shaking or sweating. The main things were the rapid heartbeat, some mild confusion, and feeling a bit agitated during that time. I didn’t have trouble sleeping that I remember.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your recovery overall—have you felt able to get back to your usual activities, or are you still feeling more tired or weak than normal? Sometimes after these episodes, it can take a little while to feel like yourself again.

**Patient**: I've started to get back to my usual activities now. I don't feel as tired or weak as I did right after the surgery, so things are improving.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you experienced some temporary confusion and a faster heart rate after your surgery, especially when the Ativan dose was reduced. These kinds of symptoms can sometimes happen in older adults after major procedures, and certain medications—like Ativan—can play a role in both causing and preventing these effects. When the dose is lowered too quickly, the body can react with symptoms like agitation or rapid heartbeat, which usually improve as things stabilize.

The fact that your mental clarity and heart rate returned to normal within about nine days, and that you’re getting back to your usual activities, is reassuring. This pattern suggests a reversible, medication-related episode rather than something more serious or ongoing.

Moving forward, it’s important to keep an eye out for any return of confusion, persistent rapid heart rate, or new symptoms such as chest pain or severe shortness of breath. If any of those occur, let your care team know right away.

For now, gradually resuming your normal routines, staying hydrated, and getting good rest will help your recovery. If you have any concerns about medications or notice changes in how you’re feeling, don’t hesitate to bring them up. Does that all make sense? Is there anything else you’d like to go over?

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining it so clearly. I’m relieved to hear this was likely just from the medication and not something more serious. I’ll keep an eye out for any new symptoms, but right now I feel like I’m getting back to normal. If anything changes, I’ll let you know.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted for surgical management following an incomplete surveillance colonoscopy due to a large adenoma at the hepatic flexure. He underwent an extended right colectomy, initially laparoscopic but converted to open, and initially did well postoperatively with morphine PCA for pain control. On postoperative day two, he developed agitation and florid delirium tremens with tachycardia and ST depressions, attributed to alcohol withdrawal, requiring transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and treatment with Ativan drip, Lopressor, folate, thiamine, and multivitamin. He also developed aspiration pneumonia with E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus identified in sputum, treated with Levofloxacin. Past medical history includes diabetes mellitus, prostatectomy, artificial urinary sphincter, agoraphobia, osteoarthritis, and alcohol use; home medication is Celexa and he has a sulfa allergy. Neurology recommended transitioning to long-term benzodiazepine (Valium), which was successfully weaned as his mental status improved. The Foley catheter and artificial urinary sphincter were discontinued during admission. At discharge, he was stable, tolerating a soft diet, and sent home with a 10-day course of Levofloxacin and instructions to follow up in 2-3 weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting for follow-up after a colonoscopy was incomplete due to a large adenoma and subsequent surgery. Postoperatively, the patient experienced episodes of mild confusion, agitation, rapid heartbeat (noted primarily at rest), and fever, which began several days after surgery and were associated with attempts to reduce Ativan. The symptoms lasted for a few days and resolved by the ninth day after surgery, with mental clarity and heart rate returning to normal. The patient denied shaking, sweating, or sleep disturbances during these episodes and reported gradual improvement in fatigue and return to usual activities.

Relevant history includes recent surgery for a large adenoma and use of Ativan. The clinical impression was a reversible, medication-related episode of confusion and tachycardia, likely related to perioperative Ativan adjustment rather than a more serious or ongoing condition. The treatment plan included reassurance, gradual resumption of normal activities, maintaining hydration and rest, and monitoring for recurrence of confusion, persistent tachycardia, chest pain, or severe shortness of breath. The patient was advised to report any new or concerning symptoms to the care team.
