## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.980
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly realistic for a primary-care follow-up after carotid stenting, with a mild, localized facial movement concern. The doctor asks logical, stepwise questions to rule out more serious neurological deficits and provides a plausible, reassuring explanation. The patient responses are consistent and appropriate. There are no hallucinations or unsupported content; all reasoning is grounded in the provided profile and case type.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and expresses concerns appropriately. For even greater realism, the patient could ask a follow-up question or express a bit more uncertainty or curiosity about prognosis or exercises.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates excellent clinical reasoning and communication. To further enhance realism, the doctor could briefly mention the importance of regular follow-up for vascular health given the patient's history, but this is not required.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between history-taking, reassurance, and management advice. The conversation closes with an open invitation for further questions, which is good practice.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns. The doctor appropriately advises on red flag symptoms and offers clear next steps.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your main concern—what changes have you noticed with your smile, and when did you first become aware of this?

**Patient**: I noticed that the right side of my lip doesn’t move as much when I try to smile. I think I first saw it sometime after my stent procedure, but I’m not exactly sure when it started.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other changes—have you noticed difficulty speaking, eating, or any numbness or tingling on that side of your face?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any trouble speaking or eating. I haven’t felt any numbness or tingling on that side, just that my right lip doesn’t move much when I smile.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other movements—can you raise both eyebrows evenly, and can you close your eyes tightly without any difference between the two sides? This helps me understand if the change is limited to your lip or involves other facial muscles.

**Patient**: Yes, I can raise both eyebrows evenly, and I’m able to close my eyes tightly without any difference between the two sides. It really just seems limited to my right lip when I smile.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much does this change with your smile impact your daily life—does it affect your confidence, social interactions, or activities you enjoy?

**Patient**: Honestly, it’s a little embarrassing when I smile around people, but it hasn’t stopped me from doing things I enjoy. I do feel a bit self-conscious in social situations, though.

**Doctor**: Alright. Since you first noticed this, has the movement in your lip changed at all—has it improved, stayed the same, or gotten worse over time?

**Patient**: It’s pretty much stayed the same since I first noticed it. I haven’t seen any improvement or felt it getting worse.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about possible triggers—have you noticed if anything makes the movement in your lip better or worse, like fatigue, stress, or certain facial movements?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed anything that makes the movement in my lip better or worse. Fatigue, stress, or different facial movements don’t seem to affect it.

**Doctor**: I see. Have you had any recent dental work, facial injuries, or infections around your face or mouth since your stent procedure? Sometimes these can affect facial movement.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any dental work, injuries, or infections around my face or mouth since the stent procedure.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your overall health—since your stent procedure, have you experienced any new weakness, changes in coordination, or other symptoms elsewhere in your body? This helps me check if anything else might be related.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any new weakness or changes in coordination anywhere else. The only thing I’ve noticed is the change with my right lip when I smile.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, it sounds like the change in your lip movement is limited and hasn’t spread or worsened over time, and you haven’t had other symptoms like numbness, weakness elsewhere, or trouble with speech or eating. That’s reassuring, as it suggests this is likely a mild, localized issue rather than something affecting your whole nervous system.

Sometimes, after procedures or even just with aging, a small nerve branch can be affected, leading to subtle changes like this. Because your ability to move the rest of your face is normal and you’re not experiencing other symptoms, it’s less likely to be a sign of something serious.

Most of the time, these kinds of changes are benign and may stay the same or slowly improve. If it remains stable and isn’t causing functional problems, it’s reasonable to simply monitor it. However, if you ever notice new symptoms—like spreading weakness, numbness, vision changes, or trouble speaking or swallowing—it would be important to seek medical attention promptly.

For now, focusing on what you enjoy and trying not to let this affect your confidence is key. If the change continues to bother you socially, there are sometimes options like facial exercises or even seeing a specialist for further advice.

Does that explanation make sense, or is there anything else you’re concerned about?

**Patient**: That explanation makes sense, thank you. I do feel a bit relieved knowing it’s likely nothing serious. If I notice any new symptoms like you mentioned, I’ll make sure to let someone know. Is there anything specific I should be doing at home to help with this?

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it seems this change is subtle and hasn’t interfered with your ability to eat, speak, or enjoy daily activities. Since it’s been stable and limited to your smile, it’s likely related to a minor nerve effect—sometimes these things can happen after medical procedures or even without a clear cause.

The good news is that, in most cases like this, there’s no specific treatment needed, and the issue often stays the same or may slowly improve over time. At home, gentle facial exercises—like practicing big smiles or puckering your lips—may help keep your muscles active and sometimes support mild improvement, though results can vary.

Most importantly, there’s no sign here of anything more serious. If you ever notice new changes—like difficulty moving other parts of your face, trouble swallowing, or speech changes—let your healthcare provider know right away.

Otherwise, staying socially active and focusing on what you enjoy is the best approach. If you’d like, I can suggest some simple facial exercises to try at home. Would you be interested in that?

**Patient**: Yes, I’d be interested in trying some facial exercises at home if you think that could help. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly—I feel a bit better about it now.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 61-year-old woman presenting for elective left internal carotid artery stent placement due to significant carotid artery stenosis. She has a history of right internal carotid artery stenosis (75–80%), left internal carotid artery stenosis (65–70%), and a previously coiled anterior communicating artery aneurysm. On examination, she was in no acute distress, with a right carotid bruit and mild right lip asymmetry with smile; other findings were unremarkable. She underwent left carotid artery stenting without intraoperative complications and was monitored postoperatively in the ICU. There were no changes in mental status or evidence of groin hematoma, and her vital signs remained stable throughout hospitalization. The documented diagnosis was left internal carotid artery stenosis, status post stent placement. She was discharged home in stable condition with prescriptions for Plavix and aspirin, and instructed to follow up in two weeks.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with decreased movement of the right side of the lip when smiling, first noticed sometime after a stent procedure. The patient denied difficulty speaking, eating, numbness, tingling, recent dental work, facial injuries, infections, or new weakness or coordination changes elsewhere in the body. The symptom has remained stable over time, with no improvement or worsening, and is not affected by fatigue, stress, or specific facial movements; the patient can raise both eyebrows and close both eyes evenly. The patient reported mild embarrassment and self-consciousness in social situations but no impact on daily activities. Relevant history includes a prior stent procedure; no medications or allergies were mentioned. On examination, facial movement was normal except for limited right lip movement during smiling. The doctor assessed this as a mild, localized issue likely related to a minor nerve effect, possibly post-procedural and not indicative of a serious condition. The doctor recommended monitoring for new symptoms and suggested gentle facial exercises at home to keep muscles active, with reassurance that no specific treatment is needed unless new symptoms develop.
