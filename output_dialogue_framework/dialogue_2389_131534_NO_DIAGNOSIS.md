## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.920
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and symptoms. The doctor asks appropriate follow-up questions about the frequency and associated symptoms of epistaxis and hematemesis, and the patient provides relevant, believable responses. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events introduced. The conversation is cut short due to a simulation error, but up to that point, it is realistic.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could provide more detail when possible (e.g., describing the amount of blood or severity of symptoms), but the current responses are within normal conversational bounds.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning by exploring symptom onset, frequency, and associated features. For further realism, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the seriousness of hematemesis and mention next steps or reassurance.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with each question building on prior answers. The conversation ends abruptly due to a simulation error; otherwise, it is well-structured.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety or clarity concerns are present in the evaluated portion. The doctor appropriately explores red-flag symptoms without making unsupported assumptions.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some nosebleeds lately, and that's what's got me a bit concerned.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how often these nosebleeds have been happening. Is it just once or twice, or are you noticing them more regularly?

**Patient**: It's happened a few times recently, not just once. I've also had some stomach pain along with it.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your stomach pain—does it come and go, or is it more constant? Also, have you noticed any nausea or vomiting along with the pain?

**Patient**: The stomach pain comes and goes, but it's been bothering me. I've also had some nausea and I ended up vomiting blood.

**Doctor**: I see. Can you tell me when these symptoms first started—was it days, weeks, or longer ago? Also, do you have any history of similar issues in the past?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think these symptoms started a few days ago. I haven't had anything like this happen before.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you vomited blood, was it a small amount or quite a lot? And since then, have you felt lightheaded or noticed any changes in your energy level?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 64-year-old female presenting with epistaxis followed by hematemesis. She reported a history of frequent nosebleeds, recent coffee ground emesis, seven to eight days of dark or tarry stools, and crampy abdominal pain over several months. Her past medical history includes hypertension and cholecystectomy, and she was taking verapamil, aspirin, ibuprofen, and unspecified Chinese herbs on admission; she has no known allergies. On evaluation, laboratory studies showed a drop in hematocrit from 37.5 to 29.5, and endoscopy revealed active bleeding in the posterior pharynx with mild gastritis but no esophageal or duodenal lesions. The documented diagnoses were epistaxis with secondary hematemesis, mild gastritis, and anemia. Treatment included placement of Merocel in the left naris, discontinuation of aspirin and ibuprofen, initiation of Keflex 500 mg orally four times daily for five days, Protonix 40 mg daily for six weeks, and ferrous sulfate 325 mg daily for six months.
