## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile (ataxia, increased leg weakness, urinary incontinence, unable to bear weight, spinal stenosis at T2-T3). The doctor's questions are appropriate for the symptoms and the explanations are plausible. There are no unsupported diagnoses or treatments introduced, and the conversation maintains a primary-care focus on functional impact and safety. The advice to make the environment safer and monitor for red-flag symptoms is reasonable for a light case. The only minor issue is that the doctor gives a broad differential without referencing the known spinal stenosis diagnosis, but this does not introduce hallucinations.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and appropriately mentions increased urinary incontinence at the end. Consider mentioning all key symptoms (e.g., urinary incontinence) earlier for completeness.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor could reference the known diagnosis of spinal stenosis more directly when discussing possible causes, to further ground the reasoning in the patient's history. Otherwise, questioning and education are appropriate.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between topics (onset, functional impact, sensory symptoms, triggers, coordination). The summary and safety advice are well-placed.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No major safety or clarity concerns. The doctor appropriately advises on home safety and when to seek urgent care. The explanation is clear and avoids unsupported recommendations.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about what's been going on—what brings you in today?

**Patient**: I've been having more trouble with my balance and walking lately. It's gotten harder for me to get around on my own.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first started noticing these changes. Has this been a gradual thing over weeks or months, or did it come on more suddenly?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been getting worse over the past few weeks. It didn't happen all of a sudden.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your legs—have you noticed any new weakness or heaviness when you try to stand up or walk?

**Patient**: Yes, my legs definitely feel weaker than before. Standing up and walking has become a lot more difficult, and I can't really bear weight like I used to.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you had any falls or close calls recently because of these changes?

**Patient**: I haven't actually fallen, but I've had a few times where I almost lost my balance and had to grab onto something.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more question—are you having any trouble with things like getting dressed, bathing, or doing chores around the house because of these changes?

**Patient**: Yes, it's definitely harder to do things like getting dressed or chores now. The weakness in my legs and the balance issues make those daily tasks more challenging.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any changes in sensation—have you noticed numbness, tingling, or unusual feelings in your legs or feet?

**Patient**: I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling in my legs or feet. It's mainly the weakness and trouble with balance that's been bothering me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about triggers—do you notice if your balance or leg weakness gets worse at certain times of day, or after particular activities?

**Patient**: I haven't noticed a specific time or activity that makes it worse. The leg weakness and balance issues seem pretty consistent throughout the day.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about coordination—have you noticed any problems with things like your feet not landing where you expect, or trouble with activities that require precision, like buttoning a shirt or writing?

**Patient**: Yes, I've noticed that my coordination is off—sometimes my feet don't land where I expect when I'm walking. I haven't had trouble with things like buttoning a shirt or writing, though.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you're experiencing ongoing changes in your ability to move around and coordinate your steps, which have been gradually worsening over the past few weeks. The fact that this has come on slowly, without numbness or tingling, and is affecting your coordination mostly when walking points toward a problem with the way your body controls movement, rather than a sensation issue.

Often, these kinds of symptoms can be related to changes in the nervous system, muscles, or even balance centers in the inner ear. Sometimes, things like medication side effects, joint problems, or underlying medical conditions (like circulation or nerve issues) can also play a role.

Since these changes are making daily tasks harder for you and increasing your risk of falling, it’s important to address them. I’d recommend making your environment as safe as possible—using sturdy shoes, clearing obstacles at home, and considering support like a cane or walker if you haven’t already. If you notice any new symptoms like sudden severe dizziness, vision changes, slurred speech, or difficulty using your arms, those would be reasons to seek care right away.

Next steps would usually involve a closer look at your medical history and possibly some basic tests to figure out what’s causing these changes. For now, is there anything else about your health you’ve noticed recently that seems connected?

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I have noticed that my leg weakness and ataxia are making it harder to get around and I've had more trouble with urinary incontinence lately, but I can't think of anything else new. Your suggestions make sense—I'll try to be careful at home.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 63-year-old male presenting with progressive leg weakness and increased urinary incontinence over five days, on a background of one year of ataxia. He was unable to bear weight for 48 hours prior to admission and required a walker for mobility. Relevant history includes Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (treated with radiation and surgery), hypertension, and high cholesterol. Examination revealed 3/5 strength in both lower extremities, hyperreflexia in the lower limbs, and MRI evidence of spinal stenosis with posterior disc herniation at T2-T3. The documented diagnosis was spinal stenosis with posterior herniation at T2-T3. Treatment included T2-T3 decompression laminectomy followed by a revision laminectomy due to lack of neurological improvement, as well as management of new-onset atrial fibrillation with beta blocker therapy. At discharge, the patient was stable with improved but still reduced lower extremity strength (4- out of 5) and was referred for acute rehabilitation. Discharge medications included Decadron, Metoprolol, Lactulose, Colace, Dulcolax, Senna, Hydromorphone, Terazosin, Zantac, and Atorvastatin.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with increasing difficulty with balance and walking as the chief complaint. Over the past few weeks, the patient has experienced gradually worsening leg weakness, impaired coordination (notably ataxia while walking), and increased difficulty performing daily activities such as dressing and chores. There is no reported numbness, tingling, or specific triggers, and the symptoms are consistent throughout the day; the patient has not fallen but has had near-falls. The patient also reports recent worsening of urinary incontinence. Relevant medical history, medications, and allergies are not specified in the dialogue.

The clinical impression is that the symptoms are likely related to changes in movement control, possibly involving the nervous system, muscles, or balance centers, rather than sensory deficits. The physician recommends home safety modifications (such as using sturdy shoes and clearing obstacles), and considering assistive devices like a cane or walker to reduce fall risk. The patient is advised to seek immediate care if acute neurological symptoms develop. Further evaluation of medical history and basic diagnostic tests are suggested as next steps.
