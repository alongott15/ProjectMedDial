## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and the case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the burning chest sensation, explores relevant associated symptoms, and provides a reasonable explanation (acid reflux or mild esophageal irritation) given the mild, non-progressive symptoms. The patient provides clear, relevant answers and appropriately brings up the sternal wound drainage, which matches the profile. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or major omissions. The conversation is logical and grounded.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant information and appropriately brings up a secondary concern (sternal drainage). For even greater realism, the patient could mention any self-care measures tried or express specific concerns about their surgical history earlier.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and reassurance. However, given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent surgery, it would be prudent to briefly acknowledge these factors and clarify that any new or worsening chest pain should prompt immediate evaluation. The doctor could also ask directly about the sternal wound earlier.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between topics. The patient’s late mention of sternal drainage is realistic but could be prompted earlier by the doctor.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The explanation is clear and safety netting is present for escalation of symptoms. However, given the patient's cardiac history and postoperative status, a brief reminder to monitor for signs of infection or cardiac symptoms would enhance safety.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in today. What’s been bothering you the most lately?

**Patient**: I've been having this burning feeling in my chest every now and then. It's got me a bit worried.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—does this burning feeling tend to happen after eating, when lying down, or during certain activities?

**Patient**: I can't say for sure if there's a pattern. Sometimes it just comes on, and I haven't noticed it being tied to eating or lying down.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed any shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded when the burning occurs?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any sweating or feeling lightheaded. I don't get short of breath with the burning either.

**Doctor**: Got it. How long has this burning sensation been going on—are we talking days, weeks, or longer?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been happening off and on for at least a couple of weeks now.

**Doctor**: Alright. Would you say the burning sensation has been getting better, worse, or staying about the same over these past couple of weeks?

**Patient**: It’s pretty much stayed about the same. I haven’t noticed it getting any worse.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about severity—when you feel the burning, how uncomfortable is it for you? Would you rate it as mild, moderate, or severe?

**Patient**: I’d call it mild to moderate discomfort. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely noticeable when it happens.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything seem to make the burning sensation better or worse, such as certain foods, drinks, movement, or even stress?

**Patient**: Nothing really seems to make it better or worse. I haven’t noticed a connection with food, drinks, or movement. Stress might play a part, but I’m not certain.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your activity level—are you able to do your usual daily tasks without this discomfort limiting you? For example, walking, household chores, or light exercise?

**Patient**: Yes, I’m still able to do my usual daily tasks like walking and chores. The burning doesn’t really stop me from being active.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, this burning feeling has been mild to moderate, hasn’t changed much over the past couple of weeks, and isn’t interfering with your daily activities. Since it’s not linked clearly to eating, movement, or lying down, and you’re not experiencing other concerning symptoms like shortness of breath or sweating, this pattern is most often seen with common issues like acid reflux or mild irritation of the esophagus.

What often happens is that stomach acid can sometimes move up into the esophagus and cause a burning sensation, even if it’s not clearly tied to meals. Stress can also play a role in triggering these symptoms for some people. The fact that you’re able to stay active and that it hasn’t gotten worse is reassuring.

For now, you might try simple measures like avoiding large meals late in the evening, limiting spicy or acidic foods if you notice any connection, and keeping track of when these episodes happen. If the burning becomes more frequent, severe, or if you develop new symptoms like chest pain with exertion, trouble breathing, or fainting, those would be reasons to seek medical attention promptly.

Does this explanation make sense, and do you have any questions or concerns about what we’ve discussed?

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I did want to mention—I’ve noticed a small amount of what looks like serosanguinous drainage from the lower part of my sternal incision. Should I keep an eye on that too?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 75-year-old male presenting with chest pain described as occasional burning, unrelated to activity, occurring for a week and a half prior to admission. He developed chest pain and ST segment depressions during an exercise tolerance test, prompting further evaluation. His history includes coronary artery disease, migraines, and nephrolithiasis, with no known drug allergies. Cardiac catheterization revealed significant coronary artery occlusions (90% LAD, 80% diagonal 1, 70% RCA), and he subsequently underwent a three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft. Postoperatively, he experienced minimal sternal drainage managed with Vancomycin, and his white blood cell counts remained stable; the drainage resolved without further complication. The documented diagnoses were status post coronary artery bypass graft times three, migraine headaches, possible history of transient ischemic attack, and nephrolithiasis. At discharge, he was stable and sent home on medications including Lopressor, Lasix, potassium chloride, aspirin, Lipitor, Plavix, Percocet, Colace, and Alphagan eyedrops. Follow-up with his primary care provider or cardiologist was arranged for three weeks post-discharge.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with intermittent burning chest discomfort as the chief complaint. The burning sensation has been mild to moderate in severity, occurring off and on for at least a couple of weeks, without a clear pattern related to eating, lying down, or activity, and is not associated with shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness. The discomfort has remained stable over time and does not interfere with daily activities. Relevant history regarding past medical conditions, medications, or allergies is not specified. The clinical impression documented by the doctor is that the symptoms are most consistent with acid reflux or mild esophageal irritation, possibly influenced by stress. The treatment plan includes lifestyle modifications such as avoiding large meals late in the evening, limiting spicy or acidic foods if a connection is noticed, and monitoring symptom patterns. The patient was advised to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms worsen or new concerning features develop, such as chest pain with exertion, dyspnea, or syncope. The patient also reported a small amount of serosanguinous drainage from the lower sternal incision and was advised to monitor this as well.
