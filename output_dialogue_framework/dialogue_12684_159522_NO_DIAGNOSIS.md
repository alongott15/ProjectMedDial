## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and the case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the burning chest sensation, explores relevant associated symptoms, and provides a reasonable explanation (acid reflux or mild esophageal irritation) given the mild, non-progressive symptoms. The patient provides clear, relevant answers and appropriately brings up the sternal wound drainage, which matches the profile. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or major omissions. The conversation is logical and grounded.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant information and appropriately brings up a secondary concern (sternal drainage). For even greater realism, the patient could mention any self-care measures tried or express specific concerns about their surgical history earlier.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and reassurance. However, given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent surgery, it would be prudent to briefly acknowledge these factors and clarify that any new or worsening chest pain should prompt immediate evaluation. The doctor could also ask directly about the sternal wound earlier.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with smooth transitions between topics. The patient’s late mention of sternal drainage is realistic but could be prompted earlier by the doctor.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The explanation is clear and safety netting is present for escalation of symptoms. However, given the patient's cardiac history and postoperative status, a brief reminder to monitor for signs of infection or cardiac symptoms would enhance safety.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in today. What’s been bothering you the most lately?

**Patient**: I've been having this burning feeling in my chest every now and then. It's got me a bit worried.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—does this burning feeling tend to happen after eating, when lying down, or during certain activities?

**Patient**: I can't say for sure if there's a pattern. Sometimes it just comes on, and I haven't noticed it being tied to eating or lying down.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed any shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded when the burning occurs?

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any sweating or feeling lightheaded. I don't get short of breath with the burning either.

**Doctor**: Got it. How long has this burning sensation been going on—are we talking days, weeks, or longer?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been happening off and on for at least a couple of weeks now.

**Doctor**: Alright. Would you say the burning sensation has been getting better, worse, or staying about the same over these past couple of weeks?

**Patient**: It’s pretty much stayed about the same. I haven’t noticed it getting any worse.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about severity—when you feel the burning, how uncomfortable is it for you? Would you rate it as mild, moderate, or severe?

**Patient**: I’d call it mild to moderate discomfort. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely noticeable when it happens.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything seem to make the burning sensation better or worse, such as certain foods, drinks, movement, or even stress?

**Patient**: Nothing really seems to make it better or worse. I haven’t noticed a connection with food, drinks, or movement. Stress might play a part, but I’m not certain.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your activity level—are you able to do your usual daily tasks without this discomfort limiting you? For example, walking, household chores, or light exercise?

**Patient**: Yes, I’m still able to do my usual daily tasks like walking and chores. The burning doesn’t really stop me from being active.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, this burning feeling has been mild to moderate, hasn’t changed much over the past couple of weeks, and isn’t interfering with your daily activities. Since it’s not linked clearly to eating, movement, or lying down, and you’re not experiencing other concerning symptoms like shortness of breath or sweating, this pattern is most often seen with common issues like acid reflux or mild irritation of the esophagus.

What often happens is that stomach acid can sometimes move up into the esophagus and cause a burning sensation, even if it’s not clearly tied to meals. Stress can also play a role in triggering these symptoms for some people. The fact that you’re able to stay active and that it hasn’t gotten worse is reassuring.

For now, you might try simple measures like avoiding large meals late in the evening, limiting spicy or acidic foods if you notice any connection, and keeping track of when these episodes happen. If the burning becomes more frequent, severe, or if you develop new symptoms like chest pain with exertion, trouble breathing, or fainting, those would be reasons to seek medical attention promptly.

Does this explanation make sense, and do you have any questions or concerns about what we’ve discussed?

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I did want to mention—I’ve noticed a small amount of what looks like serosanguinous drainage from the lower part of my sternal incision. Should I keep an eye on that too?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 75-year-old male presenting with occasional burning chest pain unrelated to activity. Symptoms began a week and a half prior to admission, and an exercise tolerance test revealed chest pain with ST segment depressions in V4 to V6 after four minutes of exercise. Relevant history includes coronary artery disease, migraines, and nephrolithiasis, with current medications of aspirin, atenolol, Imdur, and diltiazem; no known drug allergies. Physical examination showed stable vital signs and no acute abnormalities. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a 90% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, 80% occlusion of the diagonal 1, and 70% occlusion of the right coronary artery, with an ejection fraction of 50%. The documented diagnosis was severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease. Treatment included coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) times three using the left internal mammary artery and saphenous vein grafts, along with placement of atrial wires and mediastinal and pleural tubes.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with intermittent burning sensation in the chest. The burning has been occurring off and on for at least a couple of weeks, is described as mild to moderate discomfort, and has not changed in severity or frequency; it is not clearly associated with eating, lying down, movement, or specific triggers, though stress may play a role. The patient denied associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, sweating, or lightheadedness, and reported no limitation in daily activities. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned in this conversation. On clinical assessment, the doctor noted the absence of concerning symptoms and that the discomfort was not interfering with activity. The doctor’s assessment was that the pattern is most consistent with common issues such as acid reflux or mild esophageal irritation. The doctor recommended lifestyle measures including avoiding large meals late in the evening, limiting spicy or acidic foods if any connection is noticed, and tracking episodes. The patient was advised to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms worsen or new symptoms such as chest pain with exertion, trouble breathing, or fainting develop; the patient also mentioned noticing a small amount of serosanguinous drainage from the lower part of a sternal incision and was advised to monitor this as well.
