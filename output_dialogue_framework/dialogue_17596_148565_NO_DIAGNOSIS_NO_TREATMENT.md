## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the patient's symptoms (blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, swelling, incision changes) and provides plausible clinical reasoning. The patient responses are coherent and align with the documented symptoms and diagnoses. The doctor's summary and recommendations are reasonable for a light but concerning postpartum case, and no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe interventions are introduced.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient's responses are clear and provide relevant details. For further realism, the patient could mention any attempts at self-care or specific numbers if she recalls them, but it's also realistic not to remember exact readings.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor does well to synthesize information and provide clear next steps. For improvement, the doctor could ask more directly about the incision (e.g., drainage, odor) or clarify the timing of surgery/delivery for context, but overall the approach is thorough.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate follow-up questions and explanations. The conversation transitions smoothly from symptom exploration to assessment and advice.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The doctor appropriately advises in-person evaluation given the worsening symptoms and possible infection. Safety netting is present (what to watch for, when to seek urgent care). No clarity issues detected.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hi, it's good to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I’ve been feeling pretty off lately. My blood pressure has been up, and I just haven’t been able to shake this nausea and vomiting.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first start noticing these symptoms?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly, but I think it started a few days ago. The high blood pressure and feeling sick just sort of came on together.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your blood pressure—do you usually check it at home, and if so, do you recall what the recent readings have been?

**Patient**: I do check it at home sometimes. Lately, the numbers have been higher than usual, but I don't remember the exact readings.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if anything in particular seems to trigger these episodes, or do they happen randomly throughout the day?

**Patient**: They seem to happen randomly, honestly. I haven’t noticed anything in particular that sets it off.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your nausea and vomiting—how many times a day are you actually vomiting, and are you able to keep any food or fluids down?

**Patient**: I’ve been vomiting a few times a day, and it’s really tough to keep food or drinks down right now. Even water sometimes comes right back up.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about your overall energy—are you feeling unusually tired or weak along with these symptoms, or have you noticed any headaches, vision changes, or swelling?

**Patient**: Yeah, I've definitely noticed some swelling in my legs. I haven’t had any headaches or vision changes, but I do feel pretty wiped out overall. Also, I’ve had a fever on and off.

**Doctor**: Okay. Has your blood pressure and nausea been getting better, worse, or about the same since they started a few days ago?

**Patient**: They’ve actually been getting a bit worse over the last couple of days. The nausea especially just isn’t letting up.

**Doctor**: Alright. Since you've mentioned swelling in your legs, can you tell me if it's been getting worse or staying about the same? Also, is the swelling mostly at the end of the day, or is it present all the time?

**Patient**: The swelling in my legs has been getting a little worse, and it’s there pretty much all the time now. I’ve also noticed more redness and some firmness around my abdominal incision lately.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, it sounds like you're dealing with several concerning symptoms—persistent vomiting, difficulty keeping fluids down, worsening leg swelling, and changes around your abdominal incision. When these issues happen together, especially with elevated blood pressure and fever, it can sometimes signal an underlying infection or a complication related to recent surgery.

The firmness and redness around your incision might mean it's not healing as expected, and swelling in your legs could suggest fluid retention, which can be related to your body's response to stress or infection. Vomiting and trouble with hydration are also important because they can quickly affect your overall health.

Given that these symptoms are getting worse, I would recommend you get evaluated in person soon—especially to check your incision and make sure there's no infection. In the meantime, try to sip small amounts of clear fluids frequently to avoid dehydration, and monitor your temperature and blood pressure if possible. If you develop new symptoms like confusion, severe pain, or shortness of breath, seek care right away.

Let me ask—how much are these symptoms affecting your ability to do everyday things, like walking around or taking care of yourself?

**Patient**: Yeah, it’s definitely making things harder. Walking around is tough with the leg swelling, and I’ve needed help with some basic stuff because I just feel so wiped out. The tenderness in my lower belly and during exams hasn’t helped either.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 28-year-old female presenting with elevated blood pressures, intractable nausea and vomiting, low-grade fever, and increased erythema around her abdominal incision following a recent low transverse cesarean section. She reported no unusual vaginal discharge, minimal vaginal bleeding, and denied dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, right upper quadrant pain, or visual changes. Her medical history includes class C diabetes (with prior diabetic ketoacidosis) and recent cesarean section for arrest of descent. On admission, she was found to have diabetic ketoacidosis, postpartum endomyometritis (with uterine tenderness and abdominal collection), and preeclampsia (elevated blood pressure and proteinuria). Treatment included intravenous fluids, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement, magnesium for preeclampsia, antihypertensives (labetalol and nifedipine), and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics transitioned to oral Augmentin. A percutaneous drain was placed for the abdominal collection, which was sterile on culture. The patient was discharged in stable condition after being afebrile for 24 hours, with follow-up arranged, though she signed out against medical advice.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with elevated blood pressure, persistent nausea, and vomiting as the chief complaints. Symptoms began a few days ago and have progressively worsened, with vomiting occurring several times daily and difficulty retaining food or fluids, including water. The patient also reports worsening bilateral leg swelling (present throughout the day), intermittent fever, fatigue, and new redness and firmness around a recent abdominal incision. There is no history of headache or vision changes, but the patient notes increased difficulty with daily activities due to these symptoms and lower abdominal tenderness.

Relevant medical history includes recent abdominal surgery (exact timing not specified). The clinical impression is concern for possible infection or surgical complication, given the combination of incision changes, fever, and systemic symptoms. The physician recommended urgent in-person evaluation to assess for infection and monitor for dehydration, advising the patient to sip clear fluids and track temperature and blood pressure. The patient was instructed to seek immediate care if new severe symptoms such as confusion, severe pain, or shortness of breath develop.
