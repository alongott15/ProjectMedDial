## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile, symptoms, and history. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the gastrointestinal symptoms, explores their duration and impact, and provides reasonable advice for a light case. The conversation avoids unsupported diagnoses or treatments and maintains a primary-care tone. The only minor issue is that the doctor's summary slightly downplays the seriousness of possible small bowel obstruction in an elderly patient with this history, but the advice to seek care if symptoms worsen is present.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient's responses are clear and relevant. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any previous similar episodes or reference their known medical history (e.g., prior abdominal surgery) if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor should consider referencing the patient's significant surgical and medical history (e.g., prior small bowel obstruction and abdominal surgery) when discussing possible causes and warning signs. This would demonstrate awareness of the patient's risk factors and improve safety.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good back-and-forth. The summary and advice are clear, though a brief check for red-flag symptoms (e.g., severe pain, fever, confusion) earlier in the conversation could be added.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The safety net advice is appropriate, but given the patient's age and history, the doctor could more explicitly mention the risk of recurrent obstruction and encourage prompt evaluation if symptoms persist or worsen.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in—how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having some trouble with my stomach lately. I feel pretty nauseous and it's been bothering me for a bit now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the nausea—have you actually vomited at all, or is it just the feeling of queasiness?

**Patient**: Yes, I have actually vomited a few times. It's not just the queasiness—I've been throwing up as well.

**Doctor**: Alright. When did you first notice this stomach trouble and vomiting? Has it been going on for just a day or has it lasted longer?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure when it started, but it's been going on for a few days now. The vomiting and stomach issues haven't really let up.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your stomach—have you noticed any bloating or swelling in your abdomen along with the nausea and vomiting?

**Patient**: Yes, my abdomen does feel kind of bloated and swollen along with the nausea and vomiting. It's been pretty uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you been able to eat or drink much since these symptoms started, or has your appetite decreased?

**Patient**: I really haven't been able to eat or drink much since this started. My appetite is pretty low, and with the nausea and vomiting, it's tough to keep anything down.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your abdominal bloating—does it get worse after you try to eat or drink anything, or is it constant throughout the day?

**Patient**: The bloating seems pretty constant throughout the day. Eating or drinking doesn't really make it better or worse—it just stays uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you had any changes in your bowel movements—such as constipation or diarrhea—since these symptoms began? This can help me understand if your digestive system is affected in other ways.

**Patient**: I've definitely been more constipated lately. I haven't had any diarrhea. My bowel movements have been pretty infrequent since all this started.

**Doctor**: Got it. Has this bloating and difficulty eating made it hard for you to do your usual daily activities, like getting around the house or taking care of yourself?

**Patient**: Yes, it's definitely made things harder. I've had trouble getting around and just taking care of myself like I usually do. The bloating and poor appetite make me feel pretty weak.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your nausea, vomiting, and constant abdominal bloating have been going on for several days, and you've had trouble eating or drinking, along with constipation and feeling weaker. These symptoms are commonly seen in mild gastrointestinal upset, but the combination of persistent vomiting, bloating, reduced intake, and constipation can sometimes lead to dehydration or make you feel quite unwell, especially at your age.

What often happens in situations like this is that the digestive system slows down, which can cause food and fluids to move more slowly, leading to bloating and constipation. Vomiting and poor appetite can also make it harder to maintain hydration and nutrition.

My main concern is making sure you stay hydrated and avoid complications from not eating or drinking enough. If you’re unable to keep fluids down, feel increasingly weak, or notice any new severe pain, fever, or confusion, those would be warning signs to seek medical attention promptly.

For now, try sipping small amounts of clear fluids throughout the day—water, broth, or electrolyte solutions can help. Gentle movement and warm compresses to the abdomen may ease discomfort. If things don’t start improving soon or get worse, please reach out to your healthcare provider for further evaluation.

Let me know if you have any questions about what I’ve said or if you’re noticing any other new symptoms.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining that. I’ll try sipping fluids like you suggested, but I am still pretty uncomfortable from the constipation and bloating. If things don’t get better, I’ll make sure to reach out.

## EHR Summary

The patient is an 87-year-old male presenting for evaluation after a follow-up CT scan revealed a left subdural hematoma following a motor vehicle accident. He subsequently developed increasing nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention, and imaging demonstrated a high-grade small bowel obstruction near the previous left nephrectomy surgical site. His relevant history includes left radical nephrectomy for renal oncocytoma, chronic constipation, and hyperthyroidism. The documented diagnoses were small bowel obstruction status post exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions, left subdural hematoma, left renal oncocytoma status post nephrectomy, and hyperthyroidism. Treatment included exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions, management of postoperative poor oral intake with temporary enteric feeding tube, treatment of a urinary tract infection with Levaquin, and initiation of a rigorous bowel regimen for constipation. Discharge medications included simethicone, mineral oil, lactulose, Colace, Dulcolax, Lopressor, Protonix, Darvocet-N 100, epoetin alpha, albuterol-ipratropium, albuterol nebulizer solution, heparin, methimazole, and as-needed enemas. The patient was discharged in stable condition with follow-up scheduled in two to three weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with the chief complaint of persistent nausea and vomiting. Symptoms have been ongoing for several days and include constant abdominal bloating, decreased appetite, difficulty eating or drinking, and increased constipation with infrequent bowel movements. The patient reports that these symptoms have led to weakness and difficulty performing daily activities. There is no mention of diarrhea, fever, or new severe pain.

Relevant medical history, medications, and allergies are not specified in the dialogue. The clinical impression is mild gastrointestinal upset with concern for dehydration due to persistent vomiting, poor oral intake, and constipation. The treatment plan includes sipping small amounts of clear fluids (such as water, broth, or electrolyte solutions), gentle movement, and warm compresses to the abdomen for comfort. The patient was advised to seek prompt medical attention if unable to keep fluids down, or if new severe symptoms develop.
