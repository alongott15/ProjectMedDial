## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: UNREALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.600
- **Justification**: The dialogue is mostly plausible for a mild case of hoarseness and sore throat, with appropriate history-taking and advice. However, the patient profile explicitly includes 'airway obstruction' and 'vocal cord polyp with airway obstruction and edema,' which are not addressed with sufficient seriousness. The doctor downplays the airway obstruction, treating the case as simple laryngitis, and does not mention or address the known diagnosis of vocal cord polyp or the potential risks associated with airway compromise. This is a significant omission given the profile information.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and mentions airway obstruction, which is appropriate. However, the patient could be more explicit about the severity or frequency of the obstruction to prompt further assessment.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor should acknowledge and address the airway obstruction more directly, especially given the known diagnosis of vocal cord polyp with edema. The doctor should assess for signs of respiratory distress and discuss the specific risks associated with airway compromise, rather than attributing symptoms solely to mild laryngitis.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and clear, with good rapport and structured questioning. However, it fails to escalate appropriately when airway obstruction is mentioned.

**Safety Or Clarity**: There is a safety concern: airway obstruction in an elderly patient with a vocal cord polyp and edema warrants more urgent evaluation and possibly referral to ENT or consideration of airway protection. The advice given is too reassuring for the profile provided.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in—how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having more trouble with my voice lately—it's been getting hoarse, and that's why I wanted to come in.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this is affecting your day-to-day life. Are you finding it hard to speak or do activities that you normally do because of your voice changes?

**Patient**: Yes, it's been harder to talk, and I notice my throat feels sore too. It makes me a little nervous about trying to speak up like I usually do.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed these changes with your voice and throat. Has it been going on for days, weeks, or longer?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's been getting worse over the past several days.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the hoarseness and sore throat, such as a cough, difficulty swallowing, or fever?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had a cough, fever

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your sore throat—does it feel worse at certain times of day, or after speaking a lot?

**Patient**: It does seem to get worse when I talk a lot. I don't think the time of day makes much difference.

**Doctor**: Got it. Has your voice ever completely disappeared at any point, or is it just staying hoarse?

**Patient**: My voice has just stayed hoarse—it hasn't disappeared completely.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your sore throat—would you say it's mild, moderate, or quite painful when you speak?

**Patient**: I'd say it's more on the mild side, not too painful, just uncomfortable when I talk.

**Doctor**: Okay. Since your symptoms get worse when you talk more, have you tried resting your voice or drinking warm fluids to see if that helps?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve been trying to rest my voice and sip on warm drinks. That helps a bit, but I still feel some airway obstruction at times.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your hoarseness and mild throat discomfort have been gradually worsening over several days, especially when you use your voice more. Since you're not having a cough, fever, or severe pain, and your voice hasn’t disappeared entirely, this pattern is often seen with overuse of the vocal cords or mild irritation—sometimes called laryngitis. Resting your voice and staying hydrated are helpful steps, and it’s good to hear you’re already trying those.

Most cases like this improve with continued voice rest and warm fluids. If you notice new symptoms—such as difficulty breathing, rapidly worsening obstruction, trouble swallowing, or if your hoarseness lasts more than 2-3 weeks—it would be important to let us know. For now, try to avoid whispering (which can strain your voice further) and limit speaking when possible.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything else about your symptoms that concerns you.

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll keep resting my voice and watch out for any changes, like you mentioned. If the hoarseness sticks around or gets worse, I’ll let you know.
