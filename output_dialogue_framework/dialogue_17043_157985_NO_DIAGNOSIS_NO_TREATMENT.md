## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks logical, stepwise questions about the onset, progression, associated symptoms, and impact on daily life, and provides an appropriate, non-alarmist summary and safety advice. The patient responses are coherent and match the described symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or hallucinated facts. The conversation remains focused on a light but concerning neurological presentation, without introducing severe or ICU-level events.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For even greater realism, the patient could occasionally express more emotion (e.g., concern or frustration) or ask clarifying questions.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's questions are thorough and empathetic. To enhance realism, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's feelings or offer reassurance before summarizing next steps.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and smooth, progressing from symptom history to functional impact to safety advice. Consider adding a closing summary or explicit plan for next steps (e.g., 'I recommend you go to the emergency department today').

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate and clear. The doctor could specify what type of medical setting is best for evaluation (e.g., urgent care vs. emergency department) for added clarity.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your main concern—can you tell me when you first noticed the numbness and tingling on your left side?

**Patient**: I first noticed the numbness and tingling on my left side a few days ago. That's what made me concerned enough to reach out.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your mobility—are you able to stand or walk at all right now, or is the numbness making it difficult to move your left side?

**Patient**: Right now, I’m not able to walk because of the numbness on my left side. It’s made it really hard to move that part of my body.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed any changes in your vision, speech, or ability to use your hands since this started?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any changes in my vision or speech. I do have decreased sensation in my left upper and lower extremity, and also on the left side of my stomach, which makes it harder to use my left hand.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if anything seems to make the numbness or difficulty moving better or worse throughout the day? For example, does rest, activity, or certain positions change how it feels?

**Patient**: I haven’t noticed anything that really makes it better or worse. The numbness and trouble moving my left side seem to stay the same no matter what I’m doing.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your medical history—have you ever experienced anything similar to this numbness or weakness before, or is this the first time it's happened?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t experienced anything like this before. This is the first time I’ve had numbness and weakness like this.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your day-to-day activities—how much has this numbness and difficulty moving affected things like getting dressed, preparing meals, or using your phone?

**Patient**: It’s definitely made daily tasks harder. Getting dressed and using my phone with my left hand is tough because of the decreased sensation. Preparing meals is also more challenging than usual.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any recent injuries or illnesses—have you had any falls, bumps to the head, or infections in the past week or so?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any injuries, falls, or infections recently. This numbness just started without anything like that happening.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about sensation—are you able to feel temperature changes or touch on your left side, or is it completely numb?

**Patient**: I can still feel a bit of touch and temperature on my left side, but the sensation is definitely decreased compared to normal. It’s not completely numb, just less sensitive.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms of new numbness and weakness affecting one side of your body—with no history of injury or infection—are important to pay attention to. When someone suddenly develops difficulty moving part of their body, especially if it makes walking and using their hand harder, it can sometimes be related to changes in how nerves are working, either from the brain or spinal cord.

Because this started a few days ago and hasn't improved, and is affecting your ability to do daily tasks, I recommend that you seek medical attention promptly. While some causes are minor, others (like certain nerve or circulation issues) need to be ruled out. It's good that you haven't noticed changes in speech or vision, but the combination of decreased sensation and movement on one side should be checked by a healthcare professional in person.

In the meantime, try to avoid situations where you might fall or injure yourself since your left side is less reliable right now. If you notice any new symptoms—such as trouble speaking, sudden vision changes, severe headache, or confusion—seek emergency care right away.

Would you like advice on how best to safely get evaluated, or do you have any questions about what I've explained?

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining that. I understand why it’s important to get checked out soon. Is there anything specific I should bring with me or mention when I go in for evaluation?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 49-year-old woman presenting with acute onset left-sided numbness and tingling, progressing to right upper quadrant numbness, difficulty holding objects, and inability to walk. Symptoms began at 4:45 p.m. on the day of admission and rapidly worsened, resulting in complete inability to ambulate by the time of hospital arrival. She has no significant past medical history, is not on any medications, and reports a sulfa allergy causing rash. Physical examination revealed stable vital signs. A head CT demonstrated a 3.5-cm right-sided mass with hyperintense ring enhancement and mild edema. The documented diagnosis was not explicitly stated, but findings are consistent with a brain mass. Treatment details and specific recommendations were not documented in this note.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with new onset numbness and tingling on the left side, first noticed a few days ago. Symptoms include persistent numbness and decreased sensation in the left upper and lower extremity and left side of the stomach, making it difficult to move the left side, walk, and perform daily tasks such as getting dressed, preparing meals, and using a phone. The patient reported no changes in vision or speech, no recent injuries, falls, or infections, and has not experienced similar symptoms before; sensation to touch and temperature is decreased but not completely absent. There were no specific triggers or relieving factors identified. On examination, the patient described significant functional impairment due to decreased sensation and weakness on the left side. The doctor assessed that these symptoms could be related to changes in nerve function from the brain or spinal cord and emphasized the importance of prompt medical evaluation to rule out serious causes. The doctor advised the patient to avoid situations that could lead to falls or injury and to seek emergency care if new symptoms such as trouble speaking, vision changes, severe headache, or confusion develop. The patient understood the need for timely evaluation and asked about preparing for the visit.
