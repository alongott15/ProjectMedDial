## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient profile and presents a plausible, grounded conversation for a light case of recurrent hidradenitis suppurativa with secondary infection. The doctor asks appropriate questions about symptoms, pain, drainage, and triggers, and provides reasonable advice for home care and warning signs. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or role confusion. The conversation is clear, focused, and avoids introducing severe or ICU-level events.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For added realism, the patient could mention any previous treatments or medications used for past episodes, or express concerns about recurrence.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor provides thorough assessment and education. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's HIV and diabetes status as risk factors for infection, or ask about current medications to ensure safety.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, moving from symptom description to assessment and advice. To enhance realism, a brief summary of next steps or follow-up plan could be included.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No major safety concerns. The doctor appropriately advises when to seek urgent care. For clarity, the doctor could explicitly mention that the patient’s underlying conditions (HIV, diabetes) may affect healing and infection risk.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in, and how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been having trouble with my right armpit again—there’s some pain and it started draining recently. That’s why I came in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain—can you describe what it feels like? For example, is it more sharp, throbbing, or aching?

**Patient**: The pain is more of a throbbing ache, especially around the lump in my right armpit. It gets worse when I move my arm.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has there been any redness, warmth, or swelling in the area around the lump? This helps me understand if there might be inflammation or infection.

**Patient**: Yes, the area is definitely swollen and feels warm to the touch. There’s also some redness around where it’s draining.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the drainage—what does it look like? For example, is it clear, yellow, or has any blood or odor? This can help determine if there’s an infection.

**Patient**: The drainage is brownish and has a pretty foul smell. I haven’t noticed any blood, but it’s definitely not clear.

**Doctor**: Got it. When did you first notice the lump and drainage starting this time, and has anything like this happened before?

**Patient**: I’ve had this happen before in the same spot, but this time the lump showed up a few days ago and started draining after the pain got worse.

**Doctor**: Got it. On a scale from 1 to 10, how bad is the pain right now? And does it limit how much you can use your arm or go about your usual activities?

**Patient**: Right now, the pain is around a 7 out of 10. It’s definitely making it harder for me to use my arm and do normal things.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your general health—have you had any fever, chills, or felt unusually tired since this started? This helps me check for signs that the infection might be affecting your whole body.

**Patient**: I haven’t had any fever or chills, but I did have two episodes of nausea and vomiting. I’ve felt more tired than usual too.

**Doctor**: Let’s talk about what seems to trigger these episodes. Have you noticed if anything—like shaving, deodorant, or sweating—makes this issue more likely to come back or get worse?

**Patient**: I haven’t noticed a clear trigger like shaving or deodorant. It just seems to come back in the same spot every so often, no matter what I do.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re dealing with a recurring infection or abscess in your right armpit. The warmth, swelling, redness, and especially the foul-smelling drainage suggest that bacteria may be involved. Because this has happened before and is now interfering with your daily activities, it could be a chronic issue like hidradenitis suppurativa or a recurring skin abscess.

What often happens in these cases is that blocked hair follicles or sweat glands can become infected, leading to painful lumps that sometimes burst and drain. The fact that you haven’t found a clear trigger makes sense—these can flare up without an obvious cause.

At this point, keeping the area clean and dry is important. Avoid shaving or using harsh deodorants until it heals. Warm compresses can help with discomfort and encourage drainage. If the pain worsens, you develop a fever, the redness spreads quickly, or you feel very unwell, those are signs to seek urgent care.

Given the pain level and drainage, it’s reasonable to consider seeing a healthcare provider soon for possible antibiotics or drainage if needed. Does that all make sense, or do you have any questions about what might be going on?

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I’ll be careful with the area and try the warm compresses. If the drainage doesn’t get better, should I come back in, or is there anything else I should watch for?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 43-year-old female presenting with recurrent inflammation and drainage of the right axilla, consistent with hidradenitis suppurativa. She reported a cystic lesion in the right axilla for seven days prior to admission, which burst three days before admission, resulting in increasing pain and brownish, foul-smelling drainage; she also experienced two episodes of nausea and vomiting one day prior to admission. Her relevant medical history includes HIV, hepatitis C, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, gastritis, and dyslipidemia, with previous similar episodes requiring surgical intervention. On admission, physical exam revealed indurated skin with copious purulent drainage in the right axilla, and she developed fever (up to 103.2°F) and leukopenia during hospitalization. The documented diagnosis was recurrent hidradenitis suppurativa status post multiple examinations under anesthesia with incision, drainage, and wide local debridement of the right axilla, followed by VAC dressing placement. Treatment included multiple surgical debridements, intravenous antibiotics (Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Vancomycin), pain management with Percocet, continuation of diabetes medications, and plans to resume HIV therapy as appropriate. She was discharged in good condition to a rehabilitation facility for ongoing VAC changes and antibiotic therapy, with follow-up arranged with infectious disease and plastic surgery for possible future reconstruction.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with pain and drainage from a lump in the right axilla (armpit). The pain is described as a throbbing ache, rated 7 out of 10, worsened by arm movement, and associated with swelling, warmth, redness, and foul-smelling brownish drainage. Symptoms began a few days ago, with similar episodes occurring previously in the same location; the current episode is also causing functional limitation and fatigue, with two episodes of nausea and vomiting but no fever or chills. There is no clear trigger identified for recurrence. The clinical impression is a recurring infection or abscess in the right axilla, possibly hidradenitis suppurativa or a chronic skin abscess. The treatment plan includes keeping the area clean and dry, avoiding shaving and harsh deodorants, using warm compresses, and monitoring for worsening symptoms such as increased pain, fever, spreading redness, or systemic illness. The patient was advised to seek further medical care if symptoms worsen or do not improve.
