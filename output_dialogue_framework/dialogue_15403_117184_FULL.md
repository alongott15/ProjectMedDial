## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the headache, associated symptoms, and impact on daily life. The reasoning is sound, with the doctor noting that double vision is not typical for common causes and recommending timely evaluation. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or major omissions. The patient responses are clear and relevant.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and asks a reasonable follow-up question. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any over-the-counter medications tried or express more concern or anxiety about the symptoms.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly address pain management options (e.g., acetaminophen) or offer reassurance about what to expect while waiting for further evaluation.

**Conversation Flow**: The conversation flows logically, with each question building on previous answers. The summary and plan are clear. The dialogue could be slightly more concise in the summary, but overall it is well-structured.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns detected. The doctor appropriately recommends timely evaluation and provides clear instructions about warning signs. The explanation is thorough and avoids unsupported content.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hi there, what brings you in today? Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?

**Patient**: I've been dealing with this headache on the left side of my head for about two weeks now. It's been pretty uncomfortable and I just want to figure out what's going on.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your experience with headaches in the past—have you had anything similar before, or is this a new type of headache for you?

**Patient**: This is definitely new for me. I haven't had headaches like this before.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the quality of the pain—would you describe it as throbbing, sharp, dull, or something else? And has anything seemed to trigger or relieve it so far?

**Patient**: The pain is more of a dull ache, not really throbbing or sharp. Nothing specific seems to trigger it, and taking breaks or resting doesn’t really make it go away.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed any changes in your vision, sensitivity to light or sound, or any nausea with this?

**Patient**: Yeah, I've noticed some double vision along with the headache. I haven't had any nausea or sensitivity to light or sound, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about the left facial and tooth pain—does that pain come and go, or is it constant? And is it related in any way to eating, chewing, or touching your face?

**Patient**: The pain is pretty much constant, not really coming and going. It doesn’t seem to get worse when I eat or touch my face.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any weakness, numbness, or tingling anywhere else in your body since the headache started?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any weakness, numbness, or tingling anywhere else. It’s just the headache, facial pain, and double vision.

**Doctor**: Got it. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the discomfort overall? And has this affected your ability to work or do daily activities?

**Patient**: I’d rate the discomfort around a 6 out of 10. It’s definitely made it harder to focus at work and just do normal stuff.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your sleep—have you had any changes in your sleep pattern or quality since these symptoms began? Sometimes sleep issues can play a role in headaches and concentration.

**Patient**: I haven’t really noticed any changes in my sleep since this started. I’m sleeping about the same as usual.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, this new, constant discomfort on one side of your head with double vision and facial pain is something I want to take seriously, even though you haven’t had other neurological symptoms like weakness or numbness. The combination of these features—especially the double vision—suggests that we should rule out anything affecting the nerves or structures near your eye and face.

Sometimes, issues like sinus inflammation, dental problems, or even certain types of migraines can cause similar symptoms. However, double vision isn’t typical for those more common causes, so it’s important to look a bit deeper. While your sleep hasn’t changed and you haven’t noticed triggers, the fact that this is new and affecting your daily life means it deserves attention.

My recommendation is that you should have a medical evaluation soon—ideally within the next few days—to check your eye movements and possibly get imaging if needed. In the meantime, keep track of any new symptoms like weakness, confusion, or changes in speech, as those would need urgent attention.

Let me know if you have any questions about what I’ve said or if you want advice on managing the discomfort while you wait for further evaluation.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I get why you want to check things out more closely. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to help with the headache or the double vision until I get seen?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 27-year-old female presenting with a two-week history of left-sided headache, left facial and tooth pain, and some double vision. Symptoms included a left sixth nerve palsy on examination, with no lateral gaze past midline in the left eye. Past medical history was not significant, and there were no drug allergies. Imaging revealed a large (4 cm) fusiform aneurysm in the left cavernous internal carotid artery. The documented diagnosis was left cavernous internal carotid artery aneurysm. Treatment included diagnostic angiogram, GDC coil embolization, and permanent balloon occlusion of the left internal carotid artery. The patient tolerated the procedure well, had an uneventful postoperative course, and was discharged home in stable condition. She was advised to follow up with her physician in one week.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with a chief complaint of a new, constant headache on the left side of the head persisting for approximately two weeks. The headache is described as a dull ache rated 6 out of 10 in severity, accompanied by constant left facial pain and double vision; there are no associated triggers, alleviating factors, or changes in sleep, and no history of similar headaches. The patient denies nausea, sensitivity to light or sound, weakness, numbness, or tingling. There is no relevant past medical history or medication use documented. The clinical impression is that the combination of new unilateral headache, facial pain, and double vision warrants further evaluation to rule out neurological or structural causes near the eye and face; common causes like sinus inflammation or migraine are considered less likely due to the presence of double vision. The treatment plan includes recommending prompt medical evaluation within the next few days, assessment of eye movements, and possible imaging. The patient was also advised to monitor for new symptoms such as weakness, confusion, or speech changes, which would require urgent attention.
