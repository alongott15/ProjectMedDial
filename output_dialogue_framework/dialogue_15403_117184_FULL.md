## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the headache, associated symptoms, and impact on daily life. The reasoning is sound, with the doctor noting that double vision is not typical for common causes and recommending timely evaluation. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or major omissions. The patient responses are clear and relevant.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and asks a reasonable follow-up question. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any over-the-counter medications tried or express more concern or anxiety about the symptoms.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For improvement, the doctor could briefly address pain management options (e.g., acetaminophen) or offer reassurance about what to expect while waiting for further evaluation.

**Conversation Flow**: The conversation flows logically, with each question building on previous answers. The summary and plan are clear. The dialogue could be slightly more concise in the summary, but overall it is well-structured.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns detected. The doctor appropriately recommends timely evaluation and provides clear instructions about warning signs. The explanation is thorough and avoids unsupported content.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hi there, what brings you in today? Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?

**Patient**: I've been dealing with this headache on the left side of my head for about two weeks now. It's been pretty uncomfortable and I just want to figure out what's going on.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your experience with headaches in the past—have you had anything similar before, or is this a new type of headache for you?

**Patient**: This is definitely new for me. I haven't had headaches like this before.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the quality of the pain—would you describe it as throbbing, sharp, dull, or something else? And has anything seemed to trigger or relieve it so far?

**Patient**: The pain is more of a dull ache, not really throbbing or sharp. Nothing specific seems to trigger it, and taking breaks or resting doesn’t really make it go away.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you noticed any changes in your vision, sensitivity to light or sound, or any nausea with this?

**Patient**: Yeah, I've noticed some double vision along with the headache. I haven't had any nausea or sensitivity to light or sound, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. Let me ask about the left facial and tooth pain—does that pain come and go, or is it constant? And is it related in any way to eating, chewing, or touching your face?

**Patient**: The pain is pretty much constant, not really coming and going. It doesn’t seem to get worse when I eat or touch my face.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any weakness, numbness, or tingling anywhere else in your body since the headache started?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any weakness, numbness, or tingling anywhere else. It’s just the headache, facial pain, and double vision.

**Doctor**: Got it. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the discomfort overall? And has this affected your ability to work or do daily activities?

**Patient**: I’d rate the discomfort around a 6 out of 10. It’s definitely made it harder to focus at work and just do normal stuff.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your sleep—have you had any changes in your sleep pattern or quality since these symptoms began? Sometimes sleep issues can play a role in headaches and concentration.

**Patient**: I haven’t really noticed any changes in my sleep since this started. I’m sleeping about the same as usual.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, this new, constant discomfort on one side of your head with double vision and facial pain is something I want to take seriously, even though you haven’t had other neurological symptoms like weakness or numbness. The combination of these features—especially the double vision—suggests that we should rule out anything affecting the nerves or structures near your eye and face.

Sometimes, issues like sinus inflammation, dental problems, or even certain types of migraines can cause similar symptoms. However, double vision isn’t typical for those more common causes, so it’s important to look a bit deeper. While your sleep hasn’t changed and you haven’t noticed triggers, the fact that this is new and affecting your daily life means it deserves attention.

My recommendation is that you should have a medical evaluation soon—ideally within the next few days—to check your eye movements and possibly get imaging if needed. In the meantime, keep track of any new symptoms like weakness, confusion, or changes in speech, as those would need urgent attention.

Let me know if you have any questions about what I’ve said or if you want advice on managing the discomfort while you wait for further evaluation.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining all that. I get why you want to check things out more closely. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to help with the headache or the double vision until I get seen?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 27-year-old female presenting with a chief complaint of left-sided headache for two weeks. Symptoms included left facial and tooth pain as well as some double vision. She had no significant past medical history and no drug allergies. On examination, she exhibited a left sixth nerve palsy, with otherwise normal cranial nerve and muscle strength findings. Imaging revealed a large (4 cm) fusiform aneurysm in the sella region of the left internal carotid artery. The documented diagnosis was left internal carotid artery aneurysm. Treatment involved GDC coil embolization and permanent balloon occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, which she tolerated well. She was discharged home in stable condition with instructions for outpatient follow-up.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with a new headache on the left side of the head, ongoing for about two weeks. Symptoms included a constant dull ache (rated 6/10 in severity), persistent left facial and tooth pain not related to eating or touch, and double vision; there was no history of similar headaches, and no associated nausea, sensitivity to light or sound, weakness, numbness, tingling, or sleep changes. The discomfort has made it harder for the patient to focus at work and perform daily activities. No relevant past medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. On assessment, the doctor noted the combination of new, constant unilateral headache, facial pain, and double vision without other neurological symptoms. The doctor explained that while sinus inflammation, dental issues, or migraines could cause some symptoms, double vision is atypical and warrants further evaluation to rule out nerve or structural causes near the eye and face. The doctor recommended prompt medical evaluation within a few days, including checking eye movements and possibly imaging, and advised monitoring for new symptoms such as weakness, confusion, or speech changes that would require urgent attention.
