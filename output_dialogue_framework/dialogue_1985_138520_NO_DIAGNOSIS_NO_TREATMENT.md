## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.920
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the chest pain, and the patient's responses are relevant and believable given her history. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The conversation is cut short due to a simulation error, but up to that point, it is realistic.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Continue providing clear, relevant answers. If possible, elaborate on symptoms' timing and frequency when prompted.

**Doctor Side**: Excellent focused questioning. Consider asking about associated symptoms such as nausea or palpitations, and clarify any recent medication changes or interventions.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural. Ensure the conversation continues to a reasonable stopping point unless interrupted by simulation constraints.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns identified. The doctor maintains clarity in questioning and summarizes information appropriately.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s good to see you today. What’s been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: My chest has been hurting, and that’s why they sent me over here.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain—can you describe what it feels like? For example, is it sharp, dull, pressure-like, or something else?

**Patient**: The pain feels like a pressure across my chest. It sometimes goes into my shoulder blades and down my arms too.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when this pressure started—was it sudden, or has it been building up over time?

**Patient**: It came on pretty suddenly. One minute I was okay, and then I just started feeling that pressure in my chest.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, sweating, or feeling lightheaded when this pressure comes on?

**Patient**: I haven’t really had any sweating or felt lightheaded. Breathing was a little harder right after my surgery, but it’s been better since then.

**Doctor**: Got it. How severe would you rate the pressure—would you say it’s mild, moderate, or quite intense? And does anything in particular seem to trigger or relieve it?

**Patient**: I’d call it moderate most of the time. Lying down and resting seems to help, but it doesn’t go away completely.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—how long does each episode of pressure last, and has it been happening multiple times a day or just once since it started?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 74-year-old woman presenting with chest pain. She experienced three days of chest pain upon awakening, radiating across her shoulder blades and down her arms, lasting one to 1.5 hours and worsening at night when lying down; the pain persisted despite heparin and nitroglycerin. Her history is significant for coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction and LAD stent, COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and prior right carotid endarterectomy; she has no known allergies. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe multivessel CAD, and she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) times four. The documented diagnoses include CAD status post CABG x4, COPD, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, and left bundle branch block. Postoperatively, she was managed with temporary pacing for heart block, weaned from ventilatory and inotropic support, and started on cardiac rehabilitation. Discharge medications included Lasix, potassium chloride, aspirin, Plavix, pravastatin, metoprolol, enalapril, Percocet, and albuterol. She was discharged to rehabilitation with follow-up arranged with her primary care provider and cardiologist.
