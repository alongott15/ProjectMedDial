## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I'm here because of my mitral regurgitation. I've been a bit anxious about it lately and wanted to get it checked out.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how you've been feeling physically—have you noticed any new symptoms like shortness of breath, fatigue, or swelling in your legs recently?

**Patient**: I haven't noticed any shortness of breath, fatigue, or swelling in my legs. My main concern is just the mitral regurgitation itself.

**Doctor**: Let me ask—have you had any recent changes in your activity level or ability to exercise, even mild ones? Sometimes subtle changes can give us clues about how things are going.

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any changes in my activity level or ability to exercise. Everything's been about the same for me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your anxiety—have you noticed that your worries about your heart are affecting your sleep or daily routines? Sometimes anxiety itself can cause physical symptoms, so understanding this helps guide next steps.

**Patient**: No, my worries haven't really affected my sleep or daily routines. I just tend to overthink things sometimes, so I wanted to make sure everything's okay.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you’re feeling physically stable, has your doctor recommended any regular check-ups or echocardiograms for your mitral regurgitation? Staying on top of routine monitoring is one way we keep things on track.

**Patient**: Yes, my doctor has mentioned regular check-ups and echocardiograms for monitoring. I try to stay on top of those appointments. Thanks for reminding me how important that is.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your anxiety—are there specific situations or thoughts that tend to trigger your concerns about your heart, or does it come up at random times? Understanding this can sometimes help with managing those feelings.

**Patient**: It usually comes up when I start thinking about my heart or have a check-up coming up. Otherwise, I don’t really notice it much.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you start thinking about your heart or have an upcoming appointment, do you ever experience any physical sensations—like palpitations, chest discomfort, or feeling your heart race—or is it mainly just a sense of worry?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any palpitations, chest discomfort, or felt my heart race. It’s mainly just a sense of worry when I think about it.

**Doctor**: Got it. When these worries come up around check-ups, do you find that talking about your concerns or having more information helps ease your mind, or do you tend to feel anxious until the appointment is over?

**Patient**: Having more information definitely helps me feel better. Talking things through and understanding what to expect makes a big difference for me.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your mitral regurgitation is stable, especially since you haven’t noticed any new symptoms or changes in your daily routine. It’s completely normal to feel anxious before check-ups, especially when you’re thinking about your heart. The fact that you’re keeping up with your appointments and monitoring is exactly what we recommend for this condition.

What often helps is knowing that, as long as you’re not experiencing symptoms like shortness of breath, swelling, or decreased exercise tolerance, it’s usually a sign things are well controlled. If any of those symptoms ever develop, that would be a reason to check in sooner.

For now, staying informed and continuing routine follow-up is the best approach. If anxiety does start to interfere more with your day-to-day life, we can talk about strategies to help manage that too. Does that help address your concerns today?

**Patient**: That does help, thank you. I feel better knowing things are stable and I’m doing what I should. I’ll keep an eye out for any new symptoms and stay on top of my check-ups.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 48-year-old male presenting with mitral regurgitation. He had a history of mitral valve disease, confirmed by cardiac catheterization showing 4+ mitral regurgitation and normal coronary arteries; no acute symptoms such as dyspnea or chest pain were documented at admission. Past medical history includes tonsillectomy, and home medications were Zestril and Klonopin, with no known drug allergies. On examination, he had a systolic murmur at the apex but was otherwise stable. The documented diagnosis was status post mitral valve repair. He underwent minimally invasive mitral valve repair without complication, experienced a transient postoperative air leak that resolved by postoperative day two, and was discharged in stable condition. Discharge medications included aspirin, lisinopril, clonazepam, docusate, amiodarone, ibuprofen, and Tylenol #3 as needed. He was advised to follow up with his physicians in three to four weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting for evaluation and reassurance regarding known mitral regurgitation. They report no new symptoms, specifically denying dyspnea, fatigue, lower extremity edema, palpitations, chest discomfort, or decreased exercise tolerance. The patient’s main concern is anxiety related to their cardiac condition, which is primarily triggered by thoughts about their heart or upcoming check-ups but does not interfere with sleep or daily routines. There is no history of recent physical decline or symptom progression.

The clinical assessment is that the mitral regurgitation is stable, with no evidence of decompensation or new cardiac symptoms. The patient is adherent to routine monitoring with regular check-ups and echocardiograms as previously recommended. The treatment plan includes continued routine follow-up and monitoring for new symptoms such as shortness of breath, swelling, or reduced exercise tolerance. The physician also offered reassurance and advised that if anxiety becomes more disruptive, further strategies for management can be discussed.
