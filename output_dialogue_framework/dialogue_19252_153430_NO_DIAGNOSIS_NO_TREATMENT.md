## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the hoarseness, sore throat, and airway symptoms, and the patient provides relevant, clear answers. The clinical reasoning is sound for a light case, with appropriate safety-netting advice and no unsupported diagnoses or treatments. There are no obvious hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient responses are clear and relevant. For even greater realism, the patient could provide slightly more detail or express more concern about the airway obstruction, given its mention in the profile.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor does well to explore symptom progression and red flags. For completeness, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the known diagnosis of vocal cord polyp (if this is a follow-up) or mention referral to ENT if symptoms persist, but the current approach is reasonable for a light case.

**Conversation Flow**: The conversation flows logically and naturally, with good turn-taking and escalation of questioning. The summary and safety-netting at the end are appropriate.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No major safety or clarity concerns. The doctor appropriately advises monitoring for worsening symptoms and when to seek further care.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What’s been bothering you most lately?

**Patient**: Lately, my voice has gotten more hoarse and it’s been bothering me. That’s really why I wanted to come in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this is affecting you—are you finding it difficult to speak or be heard in your daily activities because of the hoarseness?

**Patient**: Yes, it’s definitely harder for people to hear me now. I have to

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed a sore throat, cough, or any trouble swallowing along with the hoarseness?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve also had a sore throat along with the hoarseness. I haven’t noticed any trouble swallowing or a cough.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how long this has been going on—when did you first notice your voice starting to change?

**Patient**: I’m not sure exactly, but I think my voice started changing a couple weeks ago. It’s been getting a bit worse since then.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you had any difficulty breathing or any noisy breathing, like wheezing or stridor, along with your voice changes?

**Patient**: I have noticed some trouble with my breathing, like it feels harder to get air in at times. I haven’t had any noisy breathing, though.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything in particular seem to trigger the breathing difficulty, such as talking for a long time, physical activity, or lying down? Or does it come on randomly?

**Patient**: It doesn’t really seem to have a pattern—it just comes on randomly. I haven’t noticed anything specific that triggers it.

**Doctor**: Got it. When your breathing feels more difficult, do you ever feel lightheaded or dizzy, or do you just notice the sensation of needing to work harder to get air in?

**Patient**: I just notice that I have to work harder to get air in. I haven’t felt lightheaded or dizzy with it.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your voice—when it’s hoarse, does it ever completely disappear, or are you still able to speak, just more quietly?

**Patient**: My voice hasn’t disappeared completely—I can still speak, it’s just much quieter and more hoarse than usual.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your voice has gradually become more hoarse over the past couple of weeks, and you've started noticing it's harder to get air in at times, although you haven't had noisy breathing or felt lightheaded. Hoarseness and mild breathing difficulty can sometimes result from inflammation in the throat, such as from a viral infection or irritation, but it's important to pay attention when symptoms persist or change.

Because your symptoms have lasted a couple of weeks and you’re having some breathing difficulty, I’d recommend monitoring for any signs that things are getting worse—such as your voice disappearing completely, increasing trouble breathing, or any new swallowing problems. If any of those occur, it’s important to seek medical attention promptly.

For now, resting your voice, staying well hydrated, and avoiding irritants like smoke may help. If your symptoms continue to worsen or don’t improve in another week, it would be reasonable to have your throat examined more closely. Does that sound manageable to you, or is there anything else you’re concerned about right now?

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I’ll keep an eye out for any changes, especially if my breathing or voice gets worse. Right now, I just want to make sure the airway obstruction doesn’t become more of an issue.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 77-year-old woman presenting with increased hoarseness and sore throat for the past week. She has a history of hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, and vocal cord polyps. Examination with fiberoptic scope revealed a 3 by 3 mm left vocal cord polyp prolapsing into the trachea, causing airway obstruction and edema. The documented diagnosis was airway obstruction secondary to vocal cord polyps and edema. She was started on Decadron and Unasyn, and her Coumadin was discontinued due to elevated INR and completed DVT treatment. The plan is for surgical removal of the polyp once her INR decreases, with preoperative labs scheduled for follow-up. The patient’s throat swelling improved during admission, and she was discharged in stable condition.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with progressive hoarseness as the chief complaint. Over the past couple of weeks, the patient’s voice has become more hoarse and quieter, making it difficult to be heard, and is accompanied by a sore throat. The patient also reports intermittent dyspnea described as increased effort to inhale, without associated noisy breathing, lightheadedness, dizziness, cough, or dysphagia. There is no mention of relevant past medical history, medications, or allergies.

The clinical impression is that the hoarseness and mild breathing difficulty may be due to throat inflammation, possibly from a viral infection or irritation. The treatment plan includes voice rest, maintaining hydration, and avoiding irritants such as smoke. The patient was advised to monitor for worsening symptoms—such as complete loss of voice, increased breathing difficulty, or new swallowing problems—and to seek prompt medical attention if these occur. If symptoms persist or worsen over the next week, further examination of the throat was recommended.
