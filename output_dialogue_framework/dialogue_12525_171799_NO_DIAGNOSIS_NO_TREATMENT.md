## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile (61F, episode of diplopia and mild vertigo, known right internal carotid aneurysm). The doctor asks appropriate, focused questions about the double vision and vertigo, explores neurological symptoms, and provides a reasonable explanation and safety advice. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or test orders. The conversation is clear, logical, and avoids introducing severe or ICU-level events. The only minor gap is that the known diagnosis of right internal carotid aneurysm is not referenced directly, but this does not detract from the realism given the context.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear, relevant, and provide useful detail. To enhance realism, the patient could mention any relevant medical history if prompted (e.g., 'I have a history of an aneurysm'), but it's reasonable that this did not come up unless asked.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For completeness, the doctor could ask about past medical history or reference the known aneurysm if this was a follow-up visit or if the information was available during the encounter.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is natural and logical, with appropriate follow-up questions and explanations. The conversation ends with clear safety-netting advice and patient understanding.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate for the symptoms described. The doctor clearly explains when to seek urgent care. Clarity is high throughout.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome—what brings you in today? What’s been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I’ve been seeing double lately, and it’s making me a bit uneasy. That’s the main thing that brought me in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the double vision—when did you first notice it, and does it happen all the time or only in certain situations?

**Patient**: I first noticed the double vision a few days ago. It doesn’t happen all the time—mostly when I’m looking to the side or trying to focus on something.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other sensations—have you noticed any dizziness, unsteadiness, or a spinning feeling along with the double vision?

**Patient**: I have had some mild vertigo along with the double vision. It’s not constant, but I do notice a bit of a spinning feeling at times.

**Doctor**: Got it. When you see double, do you notice if closing one eye makes the double vision go away? This helps me determine if the issue is related to your eyes themselves or how they're working together.

**Patient**: Yes, closing one eye does make the double vision go away. It only happens when both eyes are open.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any recent headaches, weakness, numbness, or changes in speech along with these symptoms? This helps me understand if there could be any other neurological involvement.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t had any headaches, weakness, numbness, or changes in my speech. It’s really just the double vision and the mild vertigo.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything in particular seem to trigger or worsen the double vision or vertigo—for example, moving your head quickly, reading, or being in bright light?

**Patient**: Moving my head quickly seems to make the vertigo a bit worse. The double vision doesn’t really change much with light or reading.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the impact—has the double vision or vertigo been interfering with your ability to do daily tasks, like reading, driving, or walking around the house?

**Patient**: Yes, it has made things like reading and walking around a bit harder. I’ve been extra careful, especially with the vertigo.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the double vision—are the two images side-by-side, one above the other, or at an angle? This can help narrow down the possible causes.

**Patient**: They’re side-by-side when I see double. It doesn’t really look like one is above the other.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re experiencing double vision that happens when both eyes are open, especially when looking to the side, along with some mild vertigo that gets worse with quick head movements. The fact that closing one eye resolves the double vision suggests it’s likely related to how your eye muscles are working together, rather than an issue within the eye itself.

Double vision like this can sometimes be caused by temporary problems with the nerves or muscles that control eye movement—often something minor, but occasionally it can signal something that needs a closer look. Mild vertigo that’s brought on by head movement is often due to an inner ear issue, like benign positional vertigo, but since you’re also having new double vision, I’d want to be cautious.

Most of the time, these symptoms are not dangerous, especially since you haven’t had any weakness, numbness, or speech changes. Still, I’d recommend getting your eyes and nervous system checked in person soon to make sure there’s nothing more serious going on. In the meantime, try to avoid sudden head movements and be careful with activities like driving or walking on stairs.

If you notice any new symptoms—like drooping of one side of your face, trouble speaking, severe headache, weakness, or numbness—seek care right away. Otherwise, a timely checkup should help clarify what’s going on and get you feeling better.

Has the double vision or vertigo been getting better, worse, or staying about the

**Patient**: It’s been about the same since it started. I appreciate you explaining everything—I’ll make sure to be careful and get checked out soon.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 61-year-old female presenting for an elective cerebral angiogram. She previously experienced an episode of diplopia on 2117-10-21, with no further symptoms and mild vertigo that resolved at that time. Her past medical history is negative for diabetes, heart, or lung disease, and she has no known drug allergies; current medications include multivitamins, aspirin, and Lipitor. On admission, her vital signs were stable and physical examination was unremarkable. She underwent diagnostic cerebral angiogram followed by embolization and coiling of a known right internal carotid aneurysm. The procedure was tolerated well, and her postoperative course was unremarkable. She was discharged home on 2118-8-7 with instructions to resume her preoperative medications.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with new-onset double vision as the chief complaint. The double vision began a few days ago, occurs mainly when looking to the side or focusing, and resolves when one eye is closed; it is described as side-by-side images. The patient also reported mild vertigo, described as a spinning sensation that is not constant and is worsened by quick head movements; both symptoms have made reading and walking more difficult but have not changed in severity since onset. No headaches, weakness, numbness, or speech changes were reported, and there was no mention of relevant medical history, medications, or allergies. On clinical questioning, the doctor noted that the double vision is binocular and likely related to eye muscle coordination rather than an intrinsic eye problem. The assessment was possible temporary dysfunction of the nerves or muscles controlling eye movement, with mild vertigo possibly due to an inner ear issue such as benign positional vertigo, but with caution advised due to the combination of symptoms. The doctor recommended an in-person evaluation of the eyes and nervous system soon, advised avoiding sudden head movements and being careful with activities like driving or using stairs, and instructed the patient to seek immediate care if new neurological symptoms develop.
