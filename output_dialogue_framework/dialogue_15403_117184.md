## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate, stepwise questions to clarify the nature of the headache, facial and tooth pain, and double vision, and provides reasonable advice about seeking further evaluation. The patient responses are coherent and match the symptoms described in the profile. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events introduced. The conversation maintains a primary care setting and avoids unnecessary escalation.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are clear and relevant. For improvement, the patient could occasionally offer more detail (e.g., describing the quality of pain or any previous similar episodes), but overall the responses are realistic for a light case.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor is thorough and empathetic. For improvement, could briefly summarize key findings before recommendations, and avoid repeating that symptoms are 'not typical for mild conditions' multiple times. A slightly more concise approach would help.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and builds on previous answers. There is some repetition in reassurance and recommendations; streamlining these would improve pacing. Ending with concrete next steps is good practice.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety is maintained; the doctor appropriately recommends prompt evaluation without causing undue alarm. Clarity is good, but could be enhanced by summarizing action items at the end (e.g., 'Write down your symptoms and see your primary care doctor soon').

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. I understand you're experiencing a left-sided headache along with some pain in your left face and teeth—can you tell me more about when these symptoms started and how they've been affecting you?

**Patient**: Um, yeah, it's mostly this headache on the left side that started maybe a couple weeks ago. It's been pretty uncomfortable, and sometimes I notice pain in my left cheek and teeth too.

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing that—headaches and facial pain can definitely be uncomfortable. You mentioned these symptoms have been going on for a couple of weeks; have you noticed anything that seems to make the pain better or worse, such as certain activities, positions, or times of day?

**Patient**: Um, I’m not really sure if anything makes it better or worse. It’s mostly just this left-sided headache that sticks around. I haven’t noticed any specific triggers.

**Doctor**: Thank you for explaining your symptoms—it sounds quite uncomfortable to have persistent pain like this. You mentioned pain in your left cheek and teeth along with the headache; have you experienced any changes in your vision, such as double vision or blurriness?

**Patient**: Well... yeah, I have noticed some double vision lately. It’s not all the time, but it’s been happening along with the headache and the face pain. I haven’t really had any blurriness though.

**Doctor**: Thank you for letting me know about the double vision—I'm sure that's concerning. Regarding the pain in your left cheek and teeth, have you noticed any swelling, numbness, or changes in sensation in that area?

**Patient**: Um, I haven’t noticed any swelling or numbness, just the pain in my left cheek and teeth. No changes in sensation that I can tell.

**Doctor**: Thank you for clarifying—persistent pain can be frustrating. Since you mentioned pain in your left teeth, have you had any recent dental issues, such as sensitivity to hot or cold, or problems chewing on that side?

**Patient**: Um, I haven’t really had any dental issues like sensitivity or problems chewing. It’s just the pain in my left teeth along with the headache and face pain.

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing more about your symptoms—I understand this ongoing pain is uncomfortable. Have you noticed any nasal congestion, runny nose, or changes in your sense of smell along with the headache and facial pain?

**Patient**: Um, I haven’t really had any nasal congestion or runny nose, and my sense of smell seems normal. It’s mostly just the left-sided headache, face and tooth pain, and some double vision. Should I be worried about these symptoms?

**Doctor**: I understand your concern—persistent pain and double vision can be unsettling. Since the pain involves your left cheek and teeth, have you noticed any tenderness when you press on your cheek or jaw, or any difficulty opening your mouth?

**Patient**: Well, I haven’t really noticed any tenderness when I press on my cheek or jaw, and I don’t have trouble opening my mouth. It’s just the headache, left facial and tooth pain, and the double vision that’s bothering me. Do you think this could be something serious?

**Doctor**: I understand why you’re feeling concerned, especially with the double vision along with your headache and facial pain. Have you noticed any weakness or drooping on one side of your face, or any difficulty speaking or swallowing?

**Patient**: Um, I haven’t had any weakness or drooping on my face, and I haven’t had trouble speaking or swallowing. It’s mainly just the headache, left facial and tooth pain, and the double vision. Is it normal for these symptoms to last this long?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing your symptoms—persistent left-sided headache, facial and tooth pain, and occasional double vision are not typical for most light, common conditions, and it’s understandable to feel concerned. While these symptoms can sometimes relate to sinus or dental issues, the double vision makes it important to monitor closely. Have you noticed any recent fevers or feeling generally unwell?

**Patient**: Um, I haven’t had any fevers or felt generally unwell—just the left-sided headache, facial and tooth pain, and the double vision. Is it something I should be worried about, or does it usually go away on its own?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing your symptoms so clearly—I understand that persistent headache, facial and tooth pain, and double vision can be concerning. While these symptoms are not typical for most mild conditions and usually don’t resolve on their own without evaluation, I recommend seeing an eye doctor or neurologist to further assess your double vision. In the meantime, have you noticed if the double vision occurs in one eye or both eyes when you cover each eye separately?

**Patient**: Um, I’m not totally sure, but I think the double vision goes away when I cover one eye. It only happens when both eyes are open. Is that important?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing that detail—double vision that goes away when one eye is covered usually means both eyes are involved, which can sometimes relate to issues with eye movement or nerves. Given your persistent left-sided headache, facial and tooth pain, and double vision, I recommend you see a doctor soon for further evaluation. In the meantime, have you noticed any changes in your ability to move your eyes or any new eye pain?

**Patient**: Um, I haven’t noticed any problems moving my eyes or any new eye pain—just the double vision along with the headache and left facial and tooth pain. Should I be worried about nerve issues or something like that?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing your concerns—while your symptoms aren’t typical for mild conditions, the combination of persistent headache, facial and tooth pain, and double vision means it’s important to get a thorough evaluation soon. I recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary care doctor or an eye specialist to help determine the cause. In the meantime, have your symptoms changed in intensity or frequency over the past few days?

**Patient**: Um, I think the headache and facial pain have pretty much stayed the same over the past few days, and the double vision hasn’t really changed either. Is there anything I should watch out for while I wait to see a doctor?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing your symptoms and concerns—while your headache, facial and tooth pain, and double vision are not typical for mild conditions, it’s good that they haven’t worsened. Please watch for any new symptoms such as weakness, drooping of your face, trouble speaking, swallowing, or sudden changes in vision, and seek care promptly if these occur. Have you already scheduled an appointment with your doctor or would you like guidance on how to do so?

**Patient**: Um, I haven’t scheduled an appointment yet. I guess I’m just a little unsure about how urgent this is. Should I try to see a doctor as soon as possible because of the double vision and headache?

**Doctor**: Thank you for sharing your concerns—while your symptoms have not worsened, persistent headache and double vision should be evaluated soon to rule out any underlying issues. I recommend scheduling an appointment with your doctor within the next few days. Would you like help finding a provider or knowing what to mention when you call?

**Patient**: Um, yeah, I think some guidance would help. Should I just mention the left-sided headache, facial and tooth pain, and the double vision when I call? Is there anything else I should say to make sure they understand what’s going on?

**Doctor**: You’ve described a persistent left-sided headache, facial and tooth pain, and double vision—when you call to schedule, mention all these symptoms and that the double vision is present when both eyes are open. It’s understandable to feel concerned, and seeing a doctor soon will help clarify the cause. Would you like advice on what type of doctor to see first?

**Patient**: Um, yeah, I’d appreciate advice on what kind of doctor to see first. Should I start with my primary care doctor, or go straight to an eye specialist because of the double vision?

**Doctor**: Given your persistent headache, facial and tooth pain, and double vision, I recommend starting with your primary care doctor, who can assess your symptoms and refer you to an eye specialist or neurologist if needed. I understand this is concerning—would you like tips on what information to bring to your appointment?

**Patient**: Um, yeah, tips would be helpful. Should I write down when the headache and facial pain started, and mention the double vision? Is there anything else I should make sure to tell them?

## EHR Summary

Summary:

A 27-year-old female presented with a two-week history of left-sided headache, left facial and tooth pain, and some double vision. Physical examination revealed a left sixth nerve palsy. Imaging studies (CT and MRI) confirmed the presence of a large aneurysm in the sella region, specifically a 4 cm fusiform aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery. The patient underwent GDC coil embolization and permanent balloon occlusion of the affected artery. The procedure was uneventful, and she recovered well postoperatively. She was discharged home in stable condition and advised to follow up with her physician.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient reported a persistent left-sided headache that began a couple of weeks ago, accompanied by pain in the left cheek and teeth, and occasional double vision. The doctor asked about possible triggers, changes in vision, facial sensation, dental issues, nasal symptoms, and other neurological signs, but the patient denied swelling, numbness, dental sensitivity, nasal congestion, fever, weakness, drooping, or difficulty speaking or swallowing. The double vision occurs only when both eyes are open and resolves when one eye is covered. The doctor explained that these symptoms are not typical for mild conditions and recommended prompt evaluation by a primary care doctor, who may refer to an eye specialist or neurologist if needed. The patient was advised to monitor for any new or worsening symptoms such as facial weakness, speech difficulties, or sudden changes in vision and to seek care urgently if these occur. Guidance was provided on what information to share when scheduling an appointment and what details to bring to the visit. No specific diagnosis or treatment was given during the conversation.
