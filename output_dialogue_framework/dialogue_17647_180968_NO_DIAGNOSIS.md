## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile and the case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the ulcers, their progression, and relevant symptoms, and provides reasonable advice for a primary care setting. The patient responses are coherent and match the described symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe interventions introduced. The conversation remains focused on the presenting complaint and does not introduce any major errors or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any difficulties with diabetes management or other chronic conditions if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and empathetic. To further improve, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's history of diabetes and vascular disease explicitly, as these are highly relevant to wound healing.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural. The transition from symptom inquiry to management advice is smooth. The doctor could ask about systemic symptoms (e.g., fever) a bit earlier for completeness.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The advice is clear and appropriate for a light case simulation. The doctor appropriately recommends in-person evaluation for worsening ulcers.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What’s been bothering you the most with your feet lately?

**Patient**: I've got these sores on both of my Achilles heels that just won't heal, and they're pretty painful. That's what's bothering me the most right now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timeline—when did you first notice these sores starting to develop?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think these ulcers started showing up maybe a couple of weeks ago.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this is impacting your daily routine—are you able to walk around the house, or is the pain keeping you from getting up and about?

**Patient**: The pain makes it really hard for me to walk, so I haven't been able to get around the house much. I pretty much have to stay off my feet.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the appearance—have you noticed any redness, swelling, or drainage from these areas? Any signs that they might be getting infected?

**Patient**: I haven't seen any drainage or anything like that. The main thing is the pain and just not being able to walk because of it.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you had any previous issues with wounds or slow healing on your feet or legs in the past? This helps me understand if there might be underlying factors affecting the healing process.

**Patient**: No, I haven't really had wounds or slow healing like this on my feet or legs before. This is the first time it's been a problem.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or changes in the color or temperature of your feet since these sores appeared? Sometimes these changes can give us clues about circulation or nerve issues.

**Patient**: No, I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling, and my feet don't seem colder or a different color than usual. It's mainly just the pain and the ulcers themselves.

**Doctor**: Got it. Over the past couple of weeks, have these sores stayed about the same, or have they been getting larger or more painful? This helps me gauge how they're progressing.

**Patient**: They've definitely gotten more painful, and I think the ulcers might have gotten a bit bigger since they started. It's been harder for me to get comfortable or move around because of it.

**Doctor**: Okay. Have you tried any treatments at home, like cleaning the area, using ointments, or covering the sores? Knowing what you’ve already done helps me suggest the best next steps.

**Patient**: I've just been keeping them clean and covered, but I haven't used any ointments or special treatments. Is there something else I should be doing?

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like these sores are persistent and getting worse, which is making it difficult for you to move around. When wounds develop in this area and don't heal well, it can sometimes be related to pressure, poor blood flow, or even underlying conditions like diabetes—even if you haven’t had problems before.

Keeping the sores clean and covered is a good first step, but since they're not improving and are actually getting larger and more painful, it’s important to have them properly examined. This is to make sure there’s no infection starting and to check your circulation in the area. Sometimes special dressings or treatments are needed to help ulcers heal, and occasionally a referral to a wound care specialist is helpful.

For now, continue keeping the areas clean and covered, avoid putting pressure on your heels as much as possible, and watch for any new redness, warmth, swelling, or drainage—which could be signs of infection. If you notice any of those changes, or if you develop a fever, seek care promptly.

I recommend scheduling an in-person visit soon so we can assess the ulcers directly and consider further steps like checking your blood flow or screening for underlying issues. Does that plan make sense to you?

**Patient**: That makes sense, thank you for explaining everything. I'll keep watching for any signs of infection and try to stay off my feet as much as I can. Should I bring anything specific with me when I come in for the visit?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 65-year-old male presenting with bilateral ischemic Achilles heel ulcers. He reports ulcerations in the Achilles tendon area of both feet, attributed to dry skin and abrasions from scratching, with associated rest pain and inability to ambulate due to pain; he is currently wheelchair bound. His medical history includes coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft), diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. On physical exam, he was alert and cooperative, with stable vital signs and clear lungs; no acute distress was noted. The documented diagnosis is bilateral ischemic heel ulcers. Prior treatment included intravenous antibiotics at an outside hospital without improvement, and he underwent an angiogram before referral for further evaluation. Admission medications included insulin (Humulin NPH), Lopressor, Tricor, Mavik, Zocor, and sublingual nitroglycerin as needed. Further management recommendations are not specified in the note.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with painful, non-healing sores on both Achilles heels. The ulcers began approximately two weeks ago, have become more painful and possibly larger over time, and are significantly limiting the patient's ability to walk or move around the house. The patient denied any drainage, redness, swelling, numbness, tingling, color or temperature changes in the feet, and reported no prior history of wounds or slow healing on the feet or legs. On examination, there were no signs of infection described by the patient, but the doctor noted the persistence and worsening of the ulcers. The assessment was that these persistent and worsening heel ulcers may be related to pressure, poor blood flow, or underlying conditions such as diabetes, despite no previous history. The doctor advised the patient to continue keeping the sores clean and covered, avoid pressure on the heels, and monitor for signs of infection such as redness, warmth, swelling, drainage, or fever. The doctor recommended scheduling an in-person visit soon for direct assessment of the ulcers, evaluation of circulation, and consideration of further treatments or referral to a wound care specialist if needed.
