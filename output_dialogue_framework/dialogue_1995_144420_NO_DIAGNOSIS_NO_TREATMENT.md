## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks logical, stepwise questions about the patient's symptoms, focusing on claudication, surgical wound changes, and parotid swelling—all of which are present in the profile. The reasoning about possible infection is appropriate given the symptoms. The patient responses are plausible and provide relevant details. There are no unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments introduced. The conversation remains focused on mild to moderate symptoms and appropriate outpatient recommendations.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and volunteers new information (drainage) at the end, which is realistic. For further realism, the patient could mention any attempts at self-care or clarify if they have already contacted their surgeon.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and provides clear recommendations. For improvement, the doctor could ask more about the drainage earlier (color, odor, amount) and clarify whether the patient is taking antibiotics or other medications.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate follow-up questions and explanations. The closing is supportive and safety-netting is included. The doctor could explicitly invite questions earlier to enhance shared decision-making.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is clear and appropriate for a light case with warning signs. The doctor avoids making a definitive diagnosis remotely and emphasizes prompt in-person evaluation, which is safe. No major clarity issues.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. What brings you in—can you tell me more about what's been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I've been having more pain when I walk, and lately it's gotten bad enough that I have to stop because my leg hurts too much. That's the main thing that's bothering me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain—where in your leg do you feel it most strongly when you're walking?

**Patient**: It's mostly in my thigh when I walk, and the pain gets worse the farther I go. I have to stop and rest before I can keep going.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed this problem—how long has the pain with walking been going on, and has it changed over time?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly when it started, but the pain has definitely gotten worse over the last several days. At first, I could walk a bit before it hurt, but now I have to stop much sooner because the pain is stronger.

**Doctor**: Alright. Besides the discomfort when walking, have you noticed any swelling, changes in color, or temperature in your leg?

**Patient**: Yes, my leg—the one that was operated on—has been swollen, and I've noticed some redness around the incision that seems to spread away from it. The area also feels warmer than usual.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you mentioned redness and warmth near the incision, have you had any fever or chills recently?

**Patient**: I've had a temperature over 100.5 for about a day now, but I haven't noticed any chills.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you've noticed swelling and redness near the incision, does the pain or swelling seem to be getting worse quickly, or is it about the same each day?

**Patient**: Yes, the pain and swelling have been getting worse pretty quickly. The area is more red and sore than it was a few days ago.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the pain itself—would you describe it as sharp, throbbing, or more of a dull ache? And is it constant, or does it only come on when you’re walking?

**Patient**: The pain feels sharp, especially when I try to walk. It’s gotten to the point where even my pain medication doesn’t really help much anymore. When I’m resting, it’s not as bad, but walking makes it much worse.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something else—have you noticed any swelling or tenderness in your face or neck, such as around your jaw or under your ear?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve noticed some swelling on the left side of my face, around my parotid gland. It’s been tender there, too.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, there are a few things standing out to me. You have worsening discomfort with activity in your leg, along with swelling, redness, and warmth at a surgical site. You've also mentioned a fever and new swelling near your parotid gland. These symptoms together suggest that your body may be dealing with an infection—possibly at the incision or even more broadly.

When we see increasing redness, warmth, and swelling at a surgical site, especially with fever, it can mean that bacteria have gotten into the tissue. The fact that it's getting worse quickly is important and makes this something that needs attention soon. The swelling near your parotid gland could also be related to infection or inflammation.

What often happens in these cases is that the body tries to fight off the infection, which causes pain, redness, and swelling. Sometimes oral antibiotics aren't enough, and further evaluation or stronger treatment is needed.

My recommendation is that you contact your surgical team or primary care provider promptly—today if possible—to have the leg and your face examined in person. Warning signs to watch for include spreading redness, increasing swelling, difficulty moving the leg or jaw, or feeling generally very unwell.

In the meantime, try to keep the affected leg elevated when you're resting and avoid walking on it more than necessary. If your temperature goes higher or you start feeling faint or confused, seek medical attention right away.

Let me know if you have any questions about what I've explained or need help with next steps.

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining all that. I’ve also noticed some drainage from the wound on my thigh—it looks clear, but there’s more of it lately. I’ll make sure to call my doctor today like you suggested. Is there anything specific I should watch for with the drainage?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 73-year-old female presenting with claudication as the chief complaint. She reported several weeks of worsening pain with walking, progressing to significant claudication. Her relevant history includes diabetes mellitus type II, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, pancytopenia of unclear etiology, and a history of bilateral carotid endarterectomy; she has allergies to Glucophage, morphine, and codeine. The documented diagnosis was peripheral vascular disease with lower extremity stenosis. She underwent a femoral to popliteal PTFE graft with distal PTFE to posterior tibial vein bypass. Postoperatively, she developed left parotitis treated with antibiotics and had serous wound drainage managed with dressing changes; the graft remained functional. At discharge, she was stable and transferred to extended care with instructions for wound care, activity progression, and follow-up in 1–2 weeks. Discharge medications included antihypertensives, diabetes medications, aspirin, antibiotics, and pain management.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with worsening leg pain during walking, primarily in the thigh, severe enough to require stopping activity. The pain has increased over several days, is described as sharp with ambulation, and is now less responsive to pain medication; it improves with rest. Additional symptoms include swelling, redness, and warmth at a prior surgical incision on the affected leg, with these findings spreading and worsening rapidly, as well as a fever over 100.5°F for one day. The patient also reports new swelling and tenderness near the left parotid gland and increased clear drainage from the thigh wound. Relevant history includes recent leg surgery (exact timing not specified). The clinical impression is possible infection at the surgical site, with concern for spreading or systemic involvement. The treatment plan includes urgent evaluation by the surgical team or primary care provider, leg elevation, minimizing walking, and monitoring for worsening symptoms such as spreading redness, increased swelling, or systemic signs like confusion or higher fever.
