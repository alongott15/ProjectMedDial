## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile and presents a plausible, stepwise clinical reasoning process for a mild case of tongue swelling/angioedema. The doctor asks appropriate questions about onset, progression, associated symptoms, and possible triggers, and provides clear, conservative advice. The patient responses are coherent and match the provided symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe interventions introduced. The only minor gap is that the patient mentions 'wheezing' in the profile but does not bring it up in the conversation until referencing it as a possible warning sign at the end.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Consider mentioning all current symptoms listed in the profile (such as wheezing) earlier in the conversation to provide a more complete clinical picture.

**Doctor Side**: It would be prudent to specifically ask about any current breathing difficulties or wheezing, given the patient's history of COPD and angioedema, to ensure airway safety is thoroughly assessed.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and patient-centered, with good summarization and safety-netting. A brief check-in about past medical history (e.g., COPD, atrial fibrillation) could add realism.

**Safety Or Clarity**: The safety advice is appropriate for a mild case, but explicit inquiry about wheezing or breathing difficulty would further enhance safety and completeness.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s nice to see you today. What’s been bothering you lately? Can you tell me more about what brought you in?

**Patient**: I've been having some swelling in my tongue lately, and it’s been making me a bit uncomfortable. That’s really what brought me in today.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed this swelling—how long has it been going on?

**Patient**: I'm not exactly sure, but I think the swelling started a couple of days ago. It’s been getting a bit worse since then.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other sensations—have you noticed any changes in your neck, such as tightness or discomfort, or any issues with breathing or swallowing since this started?

**Patient**: Yes, I’ve noticed a strange feeling in my neck along with the tongue swelling. My speech has also become a bit slurred because of how swollen my tongue feels. I haven’t had trouble swallowing, though.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about possible triggers—have you eaten any new foods, started any new medications, or used any new products recently that might have come into contact with your mouth?

**Patient**: I haven’t tried any new foods or products lately, and I’m still taking the same medications as before. Nothing really stands out as a possible trigger to me.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed any tingling, numbness, or changes in the color of your tongue or mouth area?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any tingling or numbness. I don’t think the color of my tongue has changed, either—it just feels swollen.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much is this swelling affecting your daily activities, like eating, speaking, or sleeping?

**Patient**: It’s made speaking a bit difficult because of the slurred speech, but I can still eat and sleep normally. The swelling is definitely noticeable, though.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the strange feeling in your neck—does it feel more like pressure, tightness, or something else? And does it change when you move your head or swallow?

**Patient**: It feels more like a tightness in my neck. Moving my head doesn’t really change it, and swallowing seems about the same as usual.

**Doctor**: Okay. Since the swelling has been getting a bit worse, have you noticed any changes in your voice or any hoarseness, even if mild? Sometimes these can give clues about what's causing the tightness and swelling.

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any changes in my voice or any hoarseness. It’s mainly just the swelling and the slurred speech from my tongue.

**Doctor**: Based on what we’ve discussed, it sounds like you have a gradually worsening swelling of your tongue, which is making speech more difficult, along with a sense of tightness in your neck. The fact that you haven’t had trouble swallowing or any changes in your voice is reassuring, as those can sometimes be signs of more serious airway involvement.

What often happens with tongue swelling is that it can be related to mild irritation, an allergic reaction, or sometimes side effects from certain medications—even if you haven’t started anything new. Occasionally, swelling can occur without an obvious trigger, especially as we age.

Since you haven’t noticed any color changes, numbness, or breathing issues, and you’re able to eat and sleep normally, this points toward a milder process. However, because the swelling is getting worse and is affecting your speech, it’s important to keep an eye out for any signs of rapid progression—such as difficulty breathing, swallowing, or any sudden change in your voice.

My advice right now would be to monitor closely for any of those warning signs. If any of them develop, seek medical attention immediately. Otherwise, staying hydrated and avoiding spicy or irritating foods may help while we watch to see if the swelling improves. If it continues to worsen or doesn’t start improving in the next day or two, it would be wise to get it checked in person to rule out anything that needs specific treatment.

Let me know if you have any questions or if anything changes with your symptoms.

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll keep an eye on my symptoms, especially the swelling and any changes with my speech or breathing. If anything like wheezing gets worse, I’ll make sure to let someone know right away.

**Doctor**: Let me share my thoughts based on everything you’ve told me. The swelling you’ve noticed in your tongue, along with a sense of tightness in your neck and some changes in your speech, are important symptoms to pay attention to. Because you haven’t had any difficulty swallowing, breathing, or changes in your voice, this suggests that the swelling is currently limited and not affecting your airway, which is reassuring.

Often, tongue swelling can be triggered by irritation, mild allergic reactions, or sometimes even without a clear cause. Even medications you’ve been on for a long time can occasionally lead to this, though it’s less common. The gradual worsening over a couple of days and the lack of other symptoms like tingling or color change also point toward a milder process.

My main concern would be if the swelling were to progress quickly or start to affect your ability to breathe or swallow. That’s why it’s important to watch for any new or worsening symptoms—such as trouble breathing, swallowing, or sudden changes in your voice—and seek immediate care if they arise.

For now, keeping hydrated and avoiding anything that could further irritate your mouth is sensible. If things don’t start improving soon or get worse, it would be best to have an in-person evaluation. Please reach out right away if you notice any rapid changes or new symptoms.

**Patient**: Thank you, that all makes sense to me. I feel a bit better knowing it’s not affecting my airway right now. I’ll make sure to watch for any new symptoms and reach out if things change. Is there anything specific I should avoid eating or doing while this is going on?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 79-year-old female presenting with acute tongue swelling that began earlier in the evening. She reported waking up with a strange neck sensation and swollen tongue, but denied chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, rash, or itching; her speech was slurred due to the swelling. Her medical history includes atrial fibrillation, hypertension, depression, osteoarthritis, questionable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypercholesterolemia; she had been taking lisinopril since August of the previous year and has a Bactrim allergy. The clinical impression was angioedema, most likely secondary to ACE inhibitor use (lisinopril), as determined by Allergy Service consultation. Treatment included discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor, administration of intravenous steroids and H2 blockers, observation in the ICU, and continuation of Benadryl and famotidine; an EpiPen was prescribed for emergency use. Her antihypertensive regimen was adjusted by starting amlodipine and continuing atenolol, and her anticoagulation with warfarin was resumed after initial holding. She was discharged home in stable condition with instructions to follow up with her primary care physician and allergy specialist.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with tongue swelling as the chief complaint. The swelling began approximately two days ago and has gradually worsened, leading to slurred speech and a sensation of neck tightness, but without difficulty swallowing, breathing, or changes in voice. There are no associated symptoms such as tingling, numbness, or color changes of the tongue, and no clear triggers such as new foods, medications, or products were identified. The patient’s ability to eat and sleep remains unaffected, and there is no history of new medications or allergies reported.

The clinical impression is that the tongue swelling is likely due to mild irritation, a possible allergic reaction, or an idiopathic cause, with no evidence of airway compromise at this time. The treatment plan includes close monitoring for any signs of rapid progression—such as difficulty breathing, swallowing, or sudden voice changes—and seeking immediate medical attention if these occur. Supportive advice was given to stay hydrated and avoid spicy or irritating foods. The patient was instructed to seek in-person evaluation if symptoms worsen or do not improve within the next couple of days.
