## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is highly realistic for a light case in a patient with significant cardiac history presenting with mild symptoms (nausea, epigastric pressure). The doctor appropriately considers both cardiac and non-cardiac causes, explains reasoning, provides clear safety-netting advice, and offers practical dietary suggestions. The patient responds plausibly, asks for clarification, and agrees to monitor symptoms. There are no hallucinations or unsupported content. The only minor issue is some repetition in the closing turns.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient responses are appropriate and realistic. To improve, the patient could provide a bit more detail about the nausea (e.g., timing, triggers), but this is not essential.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor's explanations and recommendations are clear and well-grounded. To improve, the doctor could ask a few more targeted questions about the nausea (e.g., vomiting, relation to meals) or clarify if any over-the-counter remedies have been tried.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, though the closing turns are somewhat repetitive. The conversation could be wrapped up more succinctly after the main plan is agreed upon.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety-netting is strong and clear. No safety concerns. The advice is appropriate for the patient's risk profile and symptom severity.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed so far, it sounds like you're experiencing some epigastric pressure. Given your significant cardiac history, it's important for us to consider whether this could be related to your heart, as sometimes heart symptoms can present as discomfort in the upper abdomen rather than classic chest pain—this is known as atypical angina.

Let me walk you through my thinking: in people with a cardiac history, symptoms like pressure or discomfort—even if not directly in the chest—can sometimes signal reduced blood flow to the heart. I want to make sure we're not missing any warning signs. For that reason, I'll recommend that you watch closely for any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, palpitations, pain radiating to your arm or jaw, or if this episode feels similar to any previous heart events you've had.

If you notice any of those symptoms, or if the pressure becomes more severe or persistent, it's important to seek immediate medical attention. In your case, further evaluation—like an ECG or blood tests—may be needed to rule out a cardiac cause, even if the symptoms seem mild right now.

For now, please monitor your symptoms closely, avoid strenuous activity until we know more, and let me know right away if anything changes. Does this pressure feel anything like what you experienced during your past heart issues?

**Patient**: No, this pressure doesn't really feel like what I remember from my past heart issues. I haven't had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or sweating with it either. I'll keep an eye on things like you suggested.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, it sounds like this episode is different from your previous heart issues, and you’re not experiencing any classic warning signs like chest pain or shortness of breath. That’s somewhat reassuring, especially since you’re aware of what to look out for given your history.

Let me share my thoughts: in many cases, mild upper abdominal pressure can be related to something less serious, such as indigestion or mild gastritis, especially if it doesn’t come with other concerning symptoms. However, because of your cardiac background, we always want to err on the side of caution and keep monitoring for any changes.

My recommendation is to continue observing your symptoms. If the pressure resolves and doesn’t return, it’s likely nothing serious. Eating smaller meals, avoiding spicy or fatty foods, and staying hydrated can sometimes help if this is digestive in nature. But if anything changes—if you develop new symptoms like chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or if the pressure becomes more intense—it’s important to seek care promptly.

Does this plan sound reasonable to you? And would you like any tips on managing mild digestive discomfort at home?

**Patient**: Yes, that plan sounds reasonable to me. I appreciate the suggestions about diet—could you share a few tips on what foods are best to avoid right now?

**Doctor**: You might find it helpful to avoid spicy foods, fatty or fried items, caffeine, and large heavy meals for now. Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions or if anything changes.

**Patient**: Thanks for the advice. I'll stick to lighter meals and avoid the foods you mentioned. If I notice any changes in my symptoms, I'll let you know right away.

**Doctor**: Glad to hear you have a plan. Feel free to reach out if anything changes or you have more questions.

**Patient**: Yes, I’ll keep monitoring my symptoms and reach out if anything changes. Thanks for your help and the clear advice.

**Doctor**: Absolutely, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Take care.

**Patient**: Thank you, I will. If anything changes with my symptoms, I’ll get in touch right away.

**Doctor**: Got it. Feel free to reach out anytime if you have new concerns.

**Patient**: I appreciate your support. Right now, my main symptoms are just the nausea and the pressure in my upper abdomen. If anything else comes up, I'll let you know.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 64-year-old male presenting with nausea and epigastric pressure. Symptoms led to evaluation at Hospital6, where he was found to have a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease. There is no additional relevant medical history, medication, or allergy information documented. The clinical impression was non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with significant coronary artery disease. He was transferred to Hospital1 for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Further physical exam findings and specific post-operative recommendations are not specified in the note.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with epigastric pressure and nausea. The pressure was described as mild, located in the upper abdomen, and did not resemble previous heart-related symptoms; the patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, or sweating. Relevant history includes significant cardiac disease, though no current medications or allergies were mentioned. No abnormal physical findings were reported in the conversation. The doctor assessed that while the symptoms could be related to indigestion or mild gastritis, atypical angina could not be ruled out due to the patient’s cardiac history. The doctor advised close monitoring for any new or worsening symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating, palpitations, or pain radiating to the arm or jaw, and recommended seeking immediate medical attention if these occurred. Dietary recommendations included avoiding spicy foods, fatty or fried items, caffeine, and large heavy meals, and eating smaller, lighter meals. The patient was instructed to avoid strenuous activity and to reach out if symptoms changed or worsened.
