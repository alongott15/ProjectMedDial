## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile, symptoms, and history. The doctor asks logical, stepwise questions about abdominal symptoms, appetite, bowel movements, and functional status. The summary and explanation are appropriate for a light case with chronic constipation and possible bowel obstruction history. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced. The conversation is plausible for a primary care or follow-up setting.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and describes symptoms well. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any attempts at self-management (e.g., using laxatives) or express concern about recurrence given their surgical history.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor is thorough and empathetic. For improvement, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's surgical history (e.g., prior bowel surgery) to show awareness of risk factors, and could clarify if any medications or recent changes might be contributing.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with good transitions between topics. The summary and check for understanding are appropriate. The conversation could be slightly more concise in places to mimic real-world time constraints.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The doctor appropriately advises monitoring for worsening symptoms and does not make unsupported recommendations. For clarity, the doctor could mention when to seek urgent care if symptoms worsen.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's good to see you today. What brings you in—how have you been feeling lately?

**Patient**: I've been feeling pretty uncomfortable lately. My stomach feels really bloated, and it's just not normal for me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you had any nausea or vomiting along with the bloating?

**Patient**: Yes, I've had some nausea along with the bloating. It's been pretty bothersome.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other changes—have you noticed any vomiting or visible swelling of your abdomen along with these symptoms?

**Patient**: I've had some vomiting along with the bloating, and my belly looks more swollen than usual.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your eating—have you been able to keep food and drinks down, or has your appetite changed recently?

**Patient**: I haven't really been able to eat much lately. My appetite's been pretty poor, and it's hard to keep food down.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if your discomfort gets worse at certain times of day, or after eating or drinking anything specific?

**Patient**: I haven't noticed a specific time when it's worse. It seems pretty constant, no matter what I eat or drink.

**Doctor**: Got it. When did these symptoms first begin, and have they been getting worse over time?

**Patient**: I'm not sure exactly when it started, but it's been a few days now. The symptoms seem to be getting worse, especially the constipation and trouble eating.

**Doctor**: Got it. One more thing—have you had any fevers or chills along with these symptoms?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any fevers or chills with these symptoms.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your bowel movements—when was the last time you had one, and have you noticed any changes in color or consistency?

**Patient**: I haven't had a bowel movement in several days. I haven't noticed any changes in color or consistency because I just haven't been able to go.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you're dealing with ongoing abdominal swelling, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty with bowel movements and eating. These symptoms often suggest that something is slowing down or blocking the normal movement of food and waste through your digestive tract, which can lead to bloating and discomfort.

In older adults, this can sometimes happen due to constipation, medication effects, or less commonly, a blockage. Since you haven’t had a bowel movement in several days and are struggling to eat, it’s important to keep an eye out for worsening pain, persistent vomiting, or any new symptoms like fever.

How much is this affecting your day-to-day life right now? Are you able to move around and do your usual activities, or has this kept you mostly in bed or resting?

**Patient**: I’ve had to spend a lot more time resting lately, and I’m not really able to do my usual activities. This has definitely slowed me down. Thank you for explaining what might be going on.

## EHR Summary

The patient is an 87-year-old male presenting for evaluation after a follow-up CT scan revealed a left subdural hematoma following a motor vehicle accident. He subsequently developed increasing nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention, with imaging showing a high-grade small bowel obstruction near the previous left nephrectomy surgical site. His history includes left radical nephrectomy for renal oncocytoma, chronic constipation, and hyperthyroidism. The documented diagnoses were small bowel obstruction status post exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions, left subdural hematoma, left renal oncocytoma status post nephrectomy, and hyperthyroidism. Treatment included exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions, management of postoperative poor oral intake with temporary enteric feeding tube, treatment of a urinary tract infection with Levaquin, and a rigorous bowel regimen for constipation. Discharge medications included simethicone, mineral oil, lactulose, Colace, Dulcolax, Lopressor, Protonix, Darvocet-N 100, epoetin alpha, albuterol-ipratropium, albuterol nebulizer solution, heparin, methimazole, and enemas as needed. The patient was discharged in stable condition with follow-up scheduled in two to three weeks.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with abdominal bloating as the chief complaint. They report several days of progressive abdominal swelling, persistent nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, and inability to keep food down. The patient also notes constipation, with no bowel movement in several days, and denies fever or chills. Symptoms are constant and not related to specific foods or times of day. The discomfort has worsened over time and is significantly impacting daily activities, leading to increased rest and reduced activity. Relevant medical history, medications, and allergies are not specified. The clinical impression is a possible gastrointestinal motility issue such as constipation or obstruction. The doctor advised monitoring for worsening pain, persistent vomiting, or new symptoms like fever, and emphasized the importance of these symptoms in older adults.
