## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile, focusing on burn care, pain management, and functional impact. The doctor asks appropriate follow-up questions, provides reasonable advice, and does not introduce unsupported diagnoses or treatments. The patient responses are coherent and reflect realistic concerns and limitations. There are no obvious hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient could provide more detail about the timing of the burns and any previous wound care instructions received, but overall responses are appropriate and realistic.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor could clarify the timeline since the injury (e.g., 'How many days ago did you get these burns?') and reinforce the importance of follow-up for third-degree burns, which typically require specialist care. Mentioning the risks of opioid use in a patient with a history of substance abuse could be more explicit.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and patient-centered, moving from wound status to functional impact to pain management. The offer for further wound care tips is a good closing. Consider summarizing key points before ending.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No major safety concerns, but for clarity, the doctor should emphasize that third-degree burns often need in-person evaluation and may require more than home care. The advice about Percocet is appropriate but could be stronger given the patient's substance use history.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your burns—how are they healing so far? Are you able to change the dressings regularly, and have you noticed any redness, swelling, or unusual discharge from the area? These can be signs of infection, so it’s important to keep an eye on them.

**Patient**: I’ve been able to change the dressings most days, but sometimes I forget. The burns look kind of red, but I haven’t seen any weird discharge or a lot of swelling. They’re sore, especially on my arm, and moving it is a bit uncomfortable. I’m honestly not sure if they’re healing like they should—should it still hurt this much?

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how things have changed—since you first got the burns, would you say the soreness and redness are getting better, staying about the same, or getting worse? This helps me understand if the healing process is on track or if there might be a reason to look closer.

**Patient**: The soreness is about the same as when it started, and the redness hasn’t really gone away. I haven’t noticed it getting worse, but it doesn’t seem better either. No new issues like swelling or discharge though.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you mentioned the burns are still sore and moving your arm is uncomfortable, how much is this affecting your ability to do your usual daily activities—like getting dressed, working, or basic chores? This helps me gauge how much the discomfort is interfering with your routine.

**Patient**: Yeah, it’s definitely making things harder. Getting dressed takes longer, and basic stuff like cleaning or carrying things is tough with my arm feeling sore. I’ve had to ask for help a couple times.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how you’re managing the discomfort—are you using anything for pain relief, like over-the-counter medications or cool compresses? Knowing what’s helping (or not helping) can guide the best next steps for comfort and healing.

**Patient**: I’ve been taking Percocet for pain, since that’s what I have. I haven’t tried any cool compresses yet—do those actually help with burns? The soreness is still pretty strong, but the meds take the edge off.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, it sounds like your burns are still quite sore and impacting your daily routine, even though you haven't noticed any signs of infection like discharge or significant swelling. It's common for burns to be painful for a while, especially if they're deeper or cover a larger area, but persistent pain and redness that aren't improving after several days can sometimes mean the burns are slow to heal or need extra care.

Percocet can help with pain, but it's important not to rely on it for too long because of potential side effects and dependency. Cool compresses—especially in the first couple of days after a burn—can help reduce pain and inflammation, but after that, keeping the area clean and protected is most important. Since your discomfort is ongoing and affecting your ability to function, it might be a good idea to have a clinician take a look at your burns to make sure they're healing well and aren't at risk for complications.

If you notice new symptoms like increased redness, warmth, swelling, pus, fever, or if the pain suddenly gets worse, those are reasons to seek care promptly. For now, keep the area clean with gentle washing and regular dressing changes. If over-the-counter options like acetaminophen or ibuprofen control your pain well enough, those are safer for longer-term use than Percocet.

Would you like some tips on wound care or guidance about when to see someone in person?

**Patient**: Thanks, that helps a lot. I’d definitely appreciate some tips on wound care—especially for my back since it’s tough to reach on my own. I haven’t had any new symptoms like fever or pus, just the soreness and redness. If things don’t get better soon, I’ll try to see someone in person.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 28-year-old female presenting after being found unresponsive at home with associated hypothermia and minor burns to her back and right arm. She was discovered by a family member following a loud thump, was unresponsive, incontinent of urine, and had clenched jaws requiring manual opening; no tonic-clonic movements or tongue biting were observed. Her past medical history includes a remote seizure episode, intravenous drug use, depression, and recent detoxification for heroin use; current medications include Celexa, Klonopin, Percocet, Doxepin, and Seroquel, with no known drug allergies. On EMS arrival, she was hypothermic (86.0°F) and unresponsive but responded briefly to Narcan administration, with further improvement after a second dose in the Emergency Department along with warming measures. The patient denied recent heroin use but reported taking Percocet and Klonopin in the days prior to admission. Physical examination noted a generally well-appearing but somewhat unkempt woman in no acute distress. No explicit diagnosis was documented in the note. Treatment included administration of Narcan, intravenous warm saline, and warming blankets.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with concerns about healing burns, reporting persistent soreness and redness, particularly on the arm, with discomfort during movement. The patient noted that dressing changes are performed most days but occasionally forgotten; there has been no unusual discharge, significant swelling, or new symptoms such as fever or pus. The soreness and redness have remained unchanged since onset, and daily activities like dressing and chores are more difficult due to arm pain, sometimes requiring assistance. The patient is currently using Percocet for pain relief, which helps somewhat, but has not tried cool compresses. No relevant medical history or allergies were mentioned. On assessment, the doctor noted ongoing pain and redness without signs of infection, but highlighted that slow improvement may indicate delayed healing or need for further care. The doctor advised keeping the area clean with gentle washing and regular dressing changes, suggested considering over-the-counter pain medications for longer-term use instead of Percocet, and recommended seeking in-person evaluation if symptoms worsen or new signs of infection develop. The patient requested wound care tips, especially for hard-to-reach areas like the back, and agreed to seek further care if symptoms persist.
