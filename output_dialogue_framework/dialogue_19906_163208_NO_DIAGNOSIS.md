## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the patient's profile, focusing on burn care, pain management, and functional impact. The doctor asks appropriate follow-up questions, provides reasonable advice, and does not introduce unsupported diagnoses or treatments. The patient responses are coherent and reflect realistic concerns and limitations. There are no obvious hallucinations or contradictions.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient could provide more detail about the timing of the burns and any previous wound care instructions received, but overall responses are appropriate and realistic.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor could clarify the timeline since the injury (e.g., 'How many days ago did you get these burns?') and reinforce the importance of follow-up for third-degree burns, which typically require specialist care. Mentioning the risks of opioid use in a patient with a history of substance abuse could be more explicit.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and patient-centered, moving from wound status to functional impact to pain management. The offer for further wound care tips is a good closing. Consider summarizing key points before ending.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No major safety concerns, but for clarity, the doctor should emphasize that third-degree burns often need in-person evaluation and may require more than home care. The advice about Percocet is appropriate but could be stronger given the patient's substance use history.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your burns—how are they healing so far? Are you able to change the dressings regularly, and have you noticed any redness, swelling, or unusual discharge from the area? These can be signs of infection, so it’s important to keep an eye on them.

**Patient**: I’ve been able to change the dressings most days, but sometimes I forget. The burns look kind of red, but I haven’t seen any weird discharge or a lot of swelling. They’re sore, especially on my arm, and moving it is a bit uncomfortable. I’m honestly not sure if they’re healing like they should—should it still hurt this much?

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how things have changed—since you first got the burns, would you say the soreness and redness are getting better, staying about the same, or getting worse? This helps me understand if the healing process is on track or if there might be a reason to look closer.

**Patient**: The soreness is about the same as when it started, and the redness hasn’t really gone away. I haven’t noticed it getting worse, but it doesn’t seem better either. No new issues like swelling or discharge though.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since you mentioned the burns are still sore and moving your arm is uncomfortable, how much is this affecting your ability to do your usual daily activities—like getting dressed, working, or basic chores? This helps me gauge how much the discomfort is interfering with your routine.

**Patient**: Yeah, it’s definitely making things harder. Getting dressed takes longer, and basic stuff like cleaning or carrying things is tough with my arm feeling sore. I’ve had to ask for help a couple times.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how you’re managing the discomfort—are you using anything for pain relief, like over-the-counter medications or cool compresses? Knowing what’s helping (or not helping) can guide the best next steps for comfort and healing.

**Patient**: I’ve been taking Percocet for pain, since that’s what I have. I haven’t tried any cool compresses yet—do those actually help with burns? The soreness is still pretty strong, but the meds take the edge off.

**Doctor**: From what you've told me, it sounds like your burns are still quite sore and impacting your daily routine, even though you haven't noticed any signs of infection like discharge or significant swelling. It's common for burns to be painful for a while, especially if they're deeper or cover a larger area, but persistent pain and redness that aren't improving after several days can sometimes mean the burns are slow to heal or need extra care.

Percocet can help with pain, but it's important not to rely on it for too long because of potential side effects and dependency. Cool compresses—especially in the first couple of days after a burn—can help reduce pain and inflammation, but after that, keeping the area clean and protected is most important. Since your discomfort is ongoing and affecting your ability to function, it might be a good idea to have a clinician take a look at your burns to make sure they're healing well and aren't at risk for complications.

If you notice new symptoms like increased redness, warmth, swelling, pus, fever, or if the pain suddenly gets worse, those are reasons to seek care promptly. For now, keep the area clean with gentle washing and regular dressing changes. If over-the-counter options like acetaminophen or ibuprofen control your pain well enough, those are safer for longer-term use than Percocet.

Would you like some tips on wound care or guidance about when to see someone in person?

**Patient**: Thanks, that helps a lot. I’d definitely appreciate some tips on wound care—especially for my back since it’s tough to reach on my own. I haven’t had any new symptoms like fever or pus, just the soreness and redness. If things don’t get better soon, I’ll try to see someone in person.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 28-year-old female presenting after being found unresponsive at home, with a history of a prior seizure, intravenous drug use, and depression. She was discovered lying on the ground, unresponsive, incontinent of urine, and with burns to her back and right arm; her mouth was clenched shut but no tonic-clonic movements or tongue biting were observed. On arrival, she was hypothermic (86.0°F) and responded to Narcan administration, with subsequent improvement in mental status and temperature. Her past medical history includes a remote seizure, recent detoxification for heroin, and ongoing use of Percocet and Klonopin; she denied recent heroin use or suicidal ideation. The documented diagnoses were seizure, third degree burns, depression, and possible ongoing substance abuse. She was treated with Trileptal for seizure prevention, silver sulfadiazine dressings for burns, and Celexa for depression, with discontinuation of Seroquel and Doxepin due to seizure risk. The patient was advised to follow up with Neurology, Psychiatry, and Plastic Surgery, and to monitor her burns for signs of infection. Pain management included ibuprofen and a short course of Percocet as needed.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient presents with persistent soreness and redness from burns, primarily affecting the arm and back, which are interfering with daily activities such as dressing and chores. The burns remain sore and red without significant improvement since onset, but there is no reported swelling, unusual discharge, or fever to suggest infection. The patient has been able to change dressings most days and is currently using Percocet for pain relief, though the discomfort remains significant and movement is uncomfortable. There is no documented history of new symptoms such as increased redness, warmth, swelling, pus, or fever.

The clinical impression is that the burns are slow to heal, with ongoing pain and redness but no clear signs of infection at this time. The doctor advised continued wound care with gentle washing and regular dressing changes, suggested considering over-the-counter pain medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen instead of prolonged Percocet use, and recommended a clinical evaluation if symptoms worsen or do not improve. The patient requested additional wound care tips, especially for hard-to-reach areas like the back.
