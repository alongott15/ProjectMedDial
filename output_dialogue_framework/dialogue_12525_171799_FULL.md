## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile (61-year-old female with intermittent diplopia and mild vertigo, known right internal carotid aneurysm). The doctor asks appropriate clarifying questions about the symptoms, their onset, and associated features, and provides a reasonable, cautious explanation and plan for a mild case. No unsupported diagnoses, tests, or treatments are introduced. The conversation is clear, logical, and avoids major omissions or errors.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce extraneous information. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any relevant medical history (e.g., known aneurysm) if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and communication. For completeness, the doctor could briefly acknowledge the patient's known aneurysm (if aware from chart) and clarify whether any prior neurological symptoms have occurred, but this is a minor point.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is natural and logical, with smooth transitions between topics. The summary and safety-netting advice are appropriate.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns. The doctor gives clear instructions on when to seek urgent care and explains the reasoning well. If the aneurysm is known to both parties, a brief mention would further clarify risk assessment.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome, it's good to see you today. What brought you in—can you tell me what’s been bothering you lately?

**Patient**: I’ve been having some double vision lately, and it’s making me a bit uneasy. That’s really why I wanted to come in and get it checked out.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about when you first noticed this—how long has the double vision been going on, and is it constant or does it come and go?

**Patient**: I’m not exactly sure when it started, but I think it’s been a few days. The double vision isn’t there all the time—it comes and goes.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about any other symptoms—have you noticed any mild dizziness or a sensation of spinning when the double vision happens?

**Patient**: Yes, I have noticed some mild vertigo along with the double vision. It’s not very strong, but I do feel a bit dizzy at times.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you noticed if the double vision is worse at certain times of day, or when you’re doing specific activities like reading or watching TV?

**Patient**: I haven’t really noticed a pattern. The double vision seems to happen at random times, not tied to any specific activity or time of day.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this is affecting you—when the double vision occurs, does it make it hard for you to walk, read, or do tasks around the house, or is it more of a mild annoyance?

**Patient**: It’s mostly just a mild annoyance. I can still do my usual activities, but it does make things like reading a bit harder when it happens.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about your vision more closely—when you see double, is it with both eyes open, or does it go away if you cover one eye? This helps me understand if the issue is with the eyes themselves or how they’re working together.

**Patient**: The double vision goes away if I cover one eye. It only happens when both eyes are open.

**Doctor**: Got it. Since the double vision goes away when you cover one eye, this suggests it's likely related to how your eyes are working together rather than an issue inside one eye itself. Have you noticed any drooping of your eyelids, changes in the way your face moves, or any weakness or numbness elsewhere?

**Patient**: No, I haven’t noticed any drooping, weakness, or numbness anywhere. My face feels normal, and I haven’t had any changes like that.

**Doctor**: I see. Has the double vision been getting better, staying about the same, or getting worse since you first noticed it?

**Patient**: It’s been about the same since I first noticed it. I haven’t seen much change.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like your double vision is present with both eyes open and resolves when you cover one eye, which usually points to a problem with how the eyes are coordinating rather than a structural issue inside the eye. The fact that you’re also experiencing some mild vertigo, but no weakness, numbness, or drooping, is helpful in narrowing things down.

Often, intermittent double vision like this can be related to fatigue of the eye muscles or minor issues with how the nerves control those muscles. Sometimes, mild viral illnesses or even just tiredness can bring it on temporarily. The absence of more serious symptoms—like facial droop, significant weakness, or sudden changes—makes a serious cause less likely.

For now, I’d recommend keeping track of when the double vision happens and if anything seems to trigger or worsen it. Try to rest your eyes regularly, especially during activities like reading. If you develop new symptoms such as persistent weakness, trouble speaking, severe headache, or if the double vision becomes constant or much worse, those would be reasons to seek urgent care. Otherwise, we can monitor this together and consider an eye exam if it doesn’t improve in the next week or so.

Does that make sense, or is there anything else about your vision or dizziness that you’re concerned about?

**Patient**: That all makes sense, thank you for explaining it. I feel a bit better knowing it’s likely nothing serious. I’ll keep track of when it happens and let you know if anything changes.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 61-year-old female presenting for an elective cerebral angiogram due to a prior episode of diplopia and mild vertigo in October 2117, both of which had resolved. She reported no ongoing symptoms at the time of admission. Her past medical history is notable for bilateral breast implants and tonsillectomy, with no history of diabetes, heart or lung disease, bleeding problems, or drug allergies; current medications include multivitamins, aspirin, and Lipitor. Physical examination and vital signs were unremarkable on admission. The documented diagnosis was a right internal carotid aneurysm. She underwent successful diagnostic cerebral angiogram followed by embolization and coiling of the aneurysm, with an unremarkable postoperative course. The patient was discharged in stable and improved condition with instructions to resume her preoperative medications and arrange a follow-up appointment.


## Dialogue Summary

The patient is an adult presenting with intermittent double vision as the chief complaint. The double vision has been present for a few days, occurs at random times, and resolves when one eye is covered; it is not associated with specific activities or times of day. The patient also reports mild vertigo accompanying the double vision but denies any facial droop, weakness, or numbness. The symptoms are described as a mild annoyance that does not significantly interfere with daily activities. Relevant history regarding past medical conditions, medications, or allergies is not specified. The clinical impression is that the double vision is likely due to a problem with ocular coordination (possibly related to eye muscle fatigue or minor nerve issues) rather than a structural eye problem, and no serious neurological signs are present. The treatment plan includes monitoring symptoms, resting the eyes during activities like reading, and seeking urgent care if new or worsening symptoms develop; an eye exam may be considered if there is no improvement within a week.
