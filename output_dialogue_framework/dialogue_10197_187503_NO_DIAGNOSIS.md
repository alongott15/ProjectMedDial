## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.950
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate follow-up questions about the patient's symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and facial swelling, all of which are present in the profile. The doctor summarizes the findings, provides a reasonable differential (including salivary gland inflammation), and appropriately emphasizes the need to rule out cardiac or pulmonary causes given the patient's history. There are no unsupported diagnoses or recommendations, and the conversation remains focused on the patient's reported symptoms.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: The patient provides clear, relevant answers and does not introduce unsupported symptoms or details. For even greater realism, the patient could mention any prior similar episodes or clarify if these symptoms are new or recurrent.

**Doctor Side**: The doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and safety awareness. For improvement, the doctor could more explicitly reference the patient's significant cardiac history (e.g., prior MI, CABG) when discussing the seriousness of chest symptoms, to further ground the conversation in the profile.

**Conversation Flow**: The flow is logical and natural, with appropriate transitions between topics. The summary and safety netting at the end are clear and patient-centered.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is appropriate and clear. The doctor avoids making a definitive diagnosis remotely and urges in-person evaluation for potentially serious symptoms, which is safe and realistic.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it's nice to see you today. How have you been feeling lately, and is there anything in particular that's been bothering you?

**Patient**: I've been feeling pretty nauseous lately, and that's mainly what's been bothering me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about how this has been affecting your daily routine—are you able to eat and drink normally, or has your appetite changed because of the nausea?

**Patient**: I haven't really felt like eating much because of the nausea. Drinking is okay, but my appetite just isn't what it usually is.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about other symptoms—have you had any chest discomfort or shortness of breath along with the nausea?

**Patient**: Yes, I've had some chest pain and it's been a bit hard to breathe at times, especially when the nausea gets worse.

**Doctor**: Got it. How long have you been experiencing the chest discomfort and trouble breathing—did they start around the same time as your appetite changed, or did they come on separately?

**Patient**: They all seemed to start around the same time. The nausea, chest pain, and shortness of breath kind of go together for me.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about something related—have you noticed any swelling on one side of your face, or anywhere else, since these symptoms began?

**Patient**: Yes, I've noticed some swelling on the left side of my face, and that area feels tender, especially around my parotid gland.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you notice the swelling and tenderness around your parotid gland, does it get worse when you eat or think about food, or is it there all the time?

**Patient**: The swelling and tenderness are there all the time. Eating or thinking about food doesn't seem to make it any worse.

**Doctor**: Got it. How much would you say this discomfort and swelling are interfering with your day-to-day activities—are you able to do most things, or is it making daily tasks more difficult?

**Patient**: It's definitely making daily tasks harder. I get tired more easily, and the discomfort just makes everything feel more difficult than usual.

**Doctor**: Alright. Has the swelling or discomfort on your face been getting better, worse, or staying about the same since it started?

**Patient**: It's mostly stayed the same since it started. I haven't noticed it getting better or worse.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you've been dealing with ongoing nausea, a change in appetite, some chest discomfort with shortness of breath, and persistent swelling and tenderness on the left side of your face around your parotid gland. These symptoms together could be related to an inflammation or infection of the salivary gland, which can sometimes cause facial swelling and tenderness. Nausea and loss of appetite are common when you're not feeling well overall.

However, chest discomfort and trouble breathing are symptoms I take seriously, especially since they're making daily activities harder for you. While these can sometimes occur with infections or inflammation, they can also be signs of heart or lung issues, which are important to rule out.

At this point, I recommend you get checked in person as soon as possible—especially to make sure there's no underlying heart or lung concern. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and rest as much as possible. If you notice the chest discomfort or shortness of breath getting worse, or if you develop a fever, weakness, or confusion, seek medical attention right away.

Let me know if you have any questions about what we've discussed or if anything changes with your symptoms.

**Patient**: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I understand your concerns, and I'll make sure to get checked in person soon. If anything changes with my symptoms, I'll let you know right away.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 76-year-old female presenting with nausea, which serves as her anginal equivalent. She also reported chest pain and shortness of breath upon arrival to the emergency room. Her medical history is significant for coronary artery disease with prior mid-LAD stenosis, diffuse left circumflex and RCA disease, hypertension, GERD, Billroth II surgery, anemia, hyperlipidemia, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and prior hysterectomy and appendectomy. On admission, she was found to have a non-Q wave myocardial infarction. Cardiac catheterization revealed significant multivessel coronary artery disease, including a 60% distal LAD lesion, 90% OM1 lesion, 70% OM2 lesion, and 80% mid-RCA lesion. During the procedure, she continued to experience angina, which resolved after placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump. Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and she was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with nausea as the chief complaint. She reported decreased appetite due to nausea, with normal fluid intake, and described associated chest pain and shortness of breath that occur together with the nausea and appetite changes. She also noted persistent swelling and tenderness on the left side of her face around the parotid gland, which does not worsen with eating or thinking about food and has remained unchanged since onset. The symptoms have made daily activities more difficult and caused increased fatigue. No relevant past medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. On assessment, the doctor considered possible inflammation or infection of the salivary gland but expressed concern about the chest discomfort and shortness of breath, noting these could also indicate heart or lung issues. The doctor recommended in-person evaluation as soon as possible to rule out serious causes, advised staying hydrated and resting, and instructed the patient to seek immediate care if symptoms worsen or new symptoms such as fever, weakness, or confusion develop.
