## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is plausible and consistent with the provided patient profile and case type. The doctor asks appropriate questions about the nature, timing, and associated symptoms of the facial pain, and correctly notes the significance of double vision and unsteadiness in the context of recent craniotomy. The reasoning is sound, and the advice to seek further evaluation is appropriate for these symptoms. No unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe events are introduced. The patient responses are coherent and match the described symptoms.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient provides clear, relevant answers and volunteers important associated symptoms (diplopia, unsteady gait). Could be slightly more specific about severity or impact on daily life if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor demonstrates good clinical reasoning and safety awareness. Could briefly acknowledge the patient's surgical history (craniotomy for meningioma) to further contextualize the assessment.

**Conversation Flow**: Dialogue flows logically from symptom description to associated features and risk assessment. The closing summary and safety netting are clear and appropriate.

**Safety Or Clarity**: Safety advice is well-articulated. For maximal clarity, doctor could explicitly mention the relevance of recent brain surgery to current symptoms, but overall clarity and safety are strong.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Welcome in today. What’s been bothering you the most lately?

**Patient**: I've been having pain on the left side of my face, especially around my cheek and just below my eye. That's what's bothering me most right now.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the nature of the pain—would you describe it as sharp, dull, throbbing, or something else?

**Patient**: It's more of a dull pain, right in my left cheek and below my eye. It can get uncomfortable but it's not really sharp or throbbing.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about timing—when did you first notice this discomfort, and has it been constant since it began or does it come and go?

**Patient**: I first noticed the pain a few days ago. It's been pretty constant since it started, doesn't really come and go.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discomfort, like nasal congestion, changes in your sense of smell, or any swelling in the area?

**Patient**: No, I haven't had any nasal congestion or changes in my sense of smell. There isn't any swelling that I've noticed either. I have had some double vision and felt a bit unsteady on my feet, though.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the double vision and feeling unsteady—did those start at the same time as the facial discomfort, or did they come on separately?

**Patient**: They started around the same time as the facial pain, as far as I remember. I didn't really notice them separately.

**Doctor**: Alright. When you experience the double vision, is it present all the time or does it happen only when you look in certain directions?

**Patient**: The double vision is there most of the time, not just when I look in certain directions. It doesn’t seem to go away.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything in particular seem to trigger or worsen your symptoms, like moving your head, bending over, or being in bright light? Or do they stay about the same regardless of what you’re doing?

**Patient**: No, nothing really seems to make the symptoms better or worse. They stay about the same no matter what I'm doing.

**Doctor**: Alright. How severe would you rate the discomfort and unsteadiness—would you say it’s mild, moderate, or does it interfere with your ability to do daily activities like walking or reading?

**Patient**: The discomfort and unsteadiness are moderate. I can still do my usual activities, but it's definitely noticeable and makes things a bit harder than normal.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, your symptoms of constant discomfort around your left cheek, along with persistent double vision and feeling somewhat unsteady, are a bit unusual for something like simple sinus issues or a mild infection. Typically, common causes of cheek pain—like sinusitis—would come with nasal symptoms, but you haven’t noticed any congestion or swelling.

What stands out is the combination of facial discomfort with double vision and unsteadiness. These symptoms can sometimes point to irritation or involvement of nerves in that area, or possibly something affecting the structures around your eye or brain. While it’s good that you’re still able to do your daily activities, I do think it’s important to get this checked further to rule out anything more significant.

My recommendation is that you see a healthcare provider soon—preferably within the next day or two—for an in-person evaluation. If you notice any new symptoms like weakness, numbness, severe headache, difficulty speaking, or if your balance gets worse, seek care right away.

In the meantime, try to rest and avoid activities that could put you at risk if you feel unsteady. If you have any questions about what to expect or what to watch for, let me know—I'm here to help clarify.

**Patient**: Thanks for explaining that. I’ll make sure to get it checked out soon like you suggested. I appreciate you letting me know what to watch for, and I’ll keep an eye on any changes.

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 58-year-old male presenting with chronic left infraorbital and cheek pain, described as facial pain persisting for 3-4 years, partially relieved by Tegretol. He had no neurological deficits, seizures, incontinence, or falls prior to admission. Imaging revealed a left petrous sphenoid meningioma compressing the brainstem. The documented diagnosis was status post craniotomy for excision of meningioma. He underwent a left presigmoid occipital craniotomy for tumor removal, with an unremarkable intraoperative course and stable pre- and postoperative condition. Postoperatively, he experienced transient diplopia that resolved before discharge and had a brief drop in platelet count treated with one unit of platelets. Physical and occupational therapy evaluations noted a slightly unsteady gait, for which he was provided a cane and advised to use assistance when walking at home. Follow-up PT and OT were arranged for continued rehabilitation.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with pain on the left side of the face, particularly around the cheek and just below the eye. The pain was described as dull, constant since onset a few days ago, and moderately uncomfortable but not interfering with daily activities. Additional symptoms included persistent double vision and a feeling of unsteadiness, both starting around the same time as the facial discomfort; no nasal congestion, changes in smell, or swelling were reported. The patient noted that symptoms did not fluctuate with activity or position and remained moderate in severity. No relevant medical history, medications, or allergies were mentioned. On assessment, the doctor noted that the combination of facial discomfort, double vision, and unsteadiness was atypical for simple sinus issues or mild infection and could indicate nerve involvement or a problem affecting structures near the eye or brain. The doctor recommended prompt in-person evaluation within the next day or two and advised seeking immediate care if new symptoms such as weakness, numbness, severe headache, difficulty speaking, or worsening balance occurred. The patient was also advised to rest and avoid risky activities due to unsteadiness.
