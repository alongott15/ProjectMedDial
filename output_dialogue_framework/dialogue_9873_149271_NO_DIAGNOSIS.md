## Judge Evaluation

- **Decision**: REALISTIC
- **Score**: 0.970
- **Justification**: The dialogue is consistent with the patient's profile and the case type. The doctor asks relevant questions about symptoms, timing, and severity, and provides plausible advice for a mild case of recurrent hidradenitis suppurativa with secondary infection. The patient responses are coherent and match the described symptoms. There are no unsupported diagnoses, treatments, or severe interventions introduced. The conversation is grounded and flows naturally.

### Feedback for Improvement

**Patient Side**: Patient provides clear, relevant information about symptoms and responses to treatment. Could mention any previous treatments or antibiotics if prompted.

**Doctor Side**: Doctor gives thorough, empathetic explanations and appropriate home care advice. Could briefly acknowledge patient's HIV and diabetes status as factors in healing or infection risk, without introducing new management unless specified.

**Conversation Flow**: Dialogue is smooth, logical, and covers key aspects of the complaint. A closing summary or explicit check for other concerns could further enhance completeness.

**Safety Or Clarity**: No safety concerns detected. Doctor appropriately advises monitoring for worsening symptoms and clarifies when to seek further care. For clarity, could remind patient to consult before using other medications due to comorbidities.

## Dialogue Transcript

**Doctor**: Hello, it’s good to see you today. What’s been bothering you most about this issue with your underarm?

**Patient**: The pain and swelling in my right underarm have been the biggest problem. It’s happened before, but this time it’s more uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: Let me ask

**Patient**: It’s mostly the pain and the fact that it started draining this brownish, foul-smelling fluid. That’s what’s got me worried.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the timing—when did you first notice the swelling and pain this time around?

**Patient**: I first noticed the swelling and pain a few days ago. It got worse pretty quickly, and then the cyst burst.

**Doctor**: Got it. Have you noticed any redness, warmth, or spreading of the swelling to the surrounding skin?

**Patient**: Yes, there’s definitely some redness and warmth around the area. The swelling hasn’t really spread much beyond my right underarm, though.

**Doctor**: Alright. Have you had any fever, chills, or felt generally unwell since this started?

**Patient**: I haven’t had any fever or chills. I did feel pretty unwell, especially after having some nausea and vomiting a couple of times.

**Doctor**: Got it. Does anything you do—like applying heat, keeping the area clean, or taking over-the-counter pain relievers—seem to help with the discomfort, or does anything make it worse?

**Patient**: Keeping the area clean seems to help a bit, and Tylenol takes the edge off the pain. Anything touching it or moving my arm too much makes it worse.

**Doctor**: Let me ask—on a scale from 1 to 10, how intense would you rate the pain at its worst? And has it been getting better or staying about the same since the cyst drained?

**Patient**: At its worst, the pain was probably around an 8 out of 10. Since the cyst drained, the pain has gone down a bit but it’s still pretty uncomfortable.

**Doctor**: Let me ask about the appearance—have you noticed any changes in the size or color of the area since it drained, or any new lumps nearby?

**Patient**: The area got a bit smaller after it drained, but it’s still red and tender. I haven’t noticed any new lumps nearby.

**Doctor**: Based on what we've discussed, it sounds like you’re dealing with a recurring cyst under your arm that became inflamed and then drained on its own. The redness, warmth, and drainage suggest there may have been a localized infection, which is common with these types of cysts. The fact that your symptoms have improved somewhat since it drained is a good sign, and the lack of spreading or new lumps is reassuring.

Often, when a cyst like this drains, keeping the area clean and avoiding irritation helps prevent further problems. However, ongoing tenderness, persistent redness, or any worsening symptoms could mean the infection hasn’t fully resolved. Nausea and vomiting aren’t typical, so it’s important to monitor yourself for any signs that things might be getting worse—such as increasing redness, swelling, fever, or feeling more unwell.

At this point, I’d recommend continuing to keep the area clean and minimizing friction. If you notice any of the warning signs I mentioned—or if the discomfort doesn’t continue to improve—it would be a good idea to have it checked in person. Sometimes these cysts need further treatment or antibiotics if the infection doesn’t clear on its own.

Do you have any questions about what to watch for or how to care for the area at home?

**Patient**: Thanks, that all makes sense. I’ll keep an eye on the redness and drainage. Is it okay to keep using Tylenol for the pain, or should I avoid any other over-the-counter medications because of my other health issues?

## EHR Summary

The patient is a 43-year-old female presenting with recurrent inflammation and drainage of the right axilla. She reported a cystic lesion in the right axilla for seven days, with increasing pain and a cyst rupture three days prior to admission, followed by brownish, foul-smelling drainage. Associated symptoms included two episodes of nausea and vomiting one day before admission, but no fever, chills, sweats, diarrhea, constipation, or urinary symptoms. Her medical history includes HIV, hepatitis C, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus, gastritis, and hyperlipidemia; she has had previous lancing procedures for hidradenitis suppurativa in the right axilla and anogenital area. On examination, she was afebrile with slight tachycardia and otherwise stable vital signs. The clinical impression is recurrent hidradenitis suppurativa of the right axilla. Treatment included continuation of antiretroviral therapy, diabetes management with insulin, and symptomatic management with Tylenol. No known drug allergies were reported.

## Dialogue Summary

The patient presented with pain and swelling in the right underarm. Symptoms included severe pain (rated 8/10 at worst), swelling that developed over a few days and worsened quickly, spontaneous drainage of brownish, foul-smelling fluid, redness and warmth localized to the area, tenderness, and a reduction in size after drainage; the patient also reported nausea and vomiting but denied fever or chills. Keeping the area clean and using Tylenol provided some relief, while movement and contact worsened discomfort. No new lumps or spreading of swelling were noted. The doctor assessed this as a recurring cyst that became inflamed and drained spontaneously, likely with localized infection, noting improvement since drainage and no signs of spreading. The doctor recommended continuing to keep the area clean, minimizing friction, and monitoring for worsening symptoms such as increased redness, swelling, fever, or feeling more unwell. If symptoms persist or worsen, in-person evaluation and possible antibiotics may be needed.
