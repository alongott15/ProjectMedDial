      "utterance_text": "Um, let me think\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had an echocardiogram recently. The last time I remember having any cardiac imaging was maybe a year ago, after my last procedure. My cardiologist mentioned everything looked \u201cstable\u201d back then, but I haven\u2019t had anything done since these new symptoms started.\n\nI have to admit, hearing you say \u201cworsening cardiac function\u201d and \u201cheart failure\u201d makes me pretty anxious. Should I be worried that symptoms are progressing quickly? Is there anything I should be doing right now while I wait to see my cardiologist? And, um, is it common for symptoms like paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea to come and go, or does that usually mean symptoms are getting worse?",

While your recent laboratory clinical findings are reassuring in terms of kidney function and platelet count, your hemoglobin is slightly low, which could also contribute to fatigue or shortness of breath.\n\nI recommend that you closely monitor your symptoms, limit your salt and fluid intake as advised by your cardiologist, and assessk immediate medical attention if you develop severe chest pain, worsening shortness of breath at rest, rapid weight gain, or significant swelling.
