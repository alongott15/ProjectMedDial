It\u2019s almost like a dull pain in that whole area, especially on the left side. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was just from the congestion or something else.\n\nAnd about my voice\u2014I know we talked about it being hoarse, but it\u2019s definitely changed more than I expected. It\u2019s rougher and sometimes I have to clear my throat a lot just to get words out. \n\nWith all these symptoms\u2014sinus pressure, rhinorrhea, pain throat, neck swelling, and the change in my voice\u2014should I be worried this is something more serious? Or could it be related to my history with multiple myeloma or amyloid deposition?",
