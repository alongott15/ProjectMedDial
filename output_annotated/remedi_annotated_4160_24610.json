The main gastroesophageal symptoms I\u2019ve had are just the increased heartburn after bigger meals and that sour taste in my mouth sometimes. No trouble swallowing, either.\n\nI appreciate you going over all of this with me and explaining symptoms so clearly. I\u2019ll keep up with the reflux management you mentioned and try to stick to smaller meals. I just want to feel better and get back to my normal activities, you know?\n\nIf it does turn out to be angina, do people usually need to stay in the hospital, or can it be managed with medications? And is there anything else I should be watching out for while we wait for the results of the stress diagnostic evaluation and echocardiogram? I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing everything I can on my end.",
