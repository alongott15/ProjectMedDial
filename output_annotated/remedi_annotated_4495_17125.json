The bluish discoloration, known as cyanosis, can indicate that your oxygen saturation is lower than normal and should be communicated immediately to the clinical team when you arrive at the emergency department, along with your other symptoms of increased sleepiness, confusion, swelling, and decreased urination.\n\nGiven the progression of your symptoms and the changes in your respiratory status, I strongly recommend you assessk urgent medical assessment now. When you arrive, please inform the team right away about the bluish color to your lips and any recent increases in oxygen requirements. For my assessment, have you been able to measure your oxygen saturation at home with a pulse oximeter, and if so, what readings have you observed?",
