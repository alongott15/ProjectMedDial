Um, I haven\u2019t actually lost consciousness completely\u2014no full fainting spells\u2014but there were definitely a couple times where I felt like I was about to pass out. My vision got kind of blurry and I felt really weak, but I managed to sit or lie down before anything worse happened. It\u2019s been pretty scary, especially with all the chest pain and bleeding.\n\nI appreciate you taking this seriously. Is there a good chance this can be managed once I\u2019m in the hospital? And with my cardiac history and all this blood loss, is there a high risk of something like a heart attack or going into shock? I just want to know what to expect and if there\u2019s anything else I should be worried about right now.",

I\u2019ve also had some palpitations here and there, especially when I get up or after an episode of bleeding. No real confusion, though\u2014my mind feels clear, just anxious.\n\nI appreciate you keeping such a close eye on everything. Is it normal for the weakness and palpitations to get worse with ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding and possible hemodynamic instability? And once the urgent upper endoscopy is done, will they be able to stop the bleeding right away if they find the source? I\u2019m just really worried about how quickly symptoms could get worse before the procedure happens.",
