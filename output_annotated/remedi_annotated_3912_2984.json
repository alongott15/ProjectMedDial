Based on your medical history and current clinical findings, my assessment is that you are at significant risk for serious conditions such as sepsis and diabetic ketoacidosis, both of which can progress quickly and affect organ function, including the kidneys. To further guide your care, have you experienced any recent changes in your breathing pattern, such as rapid or deep breathing (sometimes called Kussmaul respirations), which can be a sign of metabolic acidosis?",

Sometimes it feels like I have to take deeper breaths, and it\u2019s almost like I\u2019m breathing faster than usual, especially when I\u2019m feeling really nauseous or my blood sugars are high. I didn\u2019t realize that could be related to metabolic acidosis or Kussmaul respirations, but I guess that makes sense with everything else going on.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m pretty anxious about all these symptoms adding up\u2014sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis, possible kidney symptoms. Should I be worried about symptoms getting worse really quickly? What happens next\u2014do I need to be in the hospital for this?
