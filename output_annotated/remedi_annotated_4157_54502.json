My mind feels clear, but I am definitely anxious about all these symptoms.\n\nThank you for being so straightforward with me. I guess with my history of DVTs and now a subtherapeutic INR, it makes sense to be extra careful. I\u2019ll head to the emergency department like you said. Is there anything specific I should tell them when I get there? And is there anything I should watch out for on the way, like if my symptoms get worse?",
