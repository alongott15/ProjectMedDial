It\u2019s mostly just the weakness and numbness in my left shoulder and both legs that\u2019s making symptoms hard.\n\nBut I am really anxious because of all these symptoms, and especially the hypoxia episodes. My oxygen saturation has dropped pretty low at times, and I know that\u2019s not good. Plus, they told me my white blood cell count is really low\u2014something like 0.3\u2014and I\u2019m neutropenic. Should I be more worried about infections with that? And is all of this connected somehow?",
