It helped, but it was a bit uncomfortable at first. Since then, I\u2019ve tried to manage symptoms at home and stay on top of my inhalers and medications.\n\nI\u2019m just feeling really anxious now, especially with you mentioning respiratory acidosis and my lungs not clearing out the carbon dioxide well enough. Is this something that can get better quickly with treatment, or is there a risk it could get worse? And if I need BiPAP again, is that usually temporary, or does it mean my COPD is getting much worse overall? I just want to make sure I understand what\u2019s happening and what to expect.",
