Tracheobronchomalacia means that the walls of your trachea and bronchi are weaker and more prone to collapsing, which can make it harder for your airways to stay open, even with stents in place; this can contribute to poor air flow and increased work of breathing, especially when secretions are thick. \n\nGiven your history and current symptoms, it\u2019s important to continue inhalers, oxygen therapy, and airway clearance techniques as recommended. If you notice worsening shortness of breath, increased drowsiness, confusion, or a drop in your oxygen saturation at home, please assessk medical attention promptly, as these may indicate further decline in your respiratory function. \n\nTo help tailor your ongoing assessment and treatment, have you been able to monitor your oxygen saturation at home, and if so, what levels have you observed during episodes of increased symptoms?",

Um, lately, when I\u2019ve been feeling more short of breath\u2014even with my home oxygen on\u2014it sometimes drops down to about 87 or 88 percent, especially if I try to get up and move around. Usually it\u2019s closer to 91 or 92 percent when I\u2019m just sitting quietly, but it hasn\u2019t been as good as it used to be.\n\nI\u2019m definitely more anxious now that I know the trpainobronchomalacia can make my airways collapse even with the stent in place. Is there anything else that can be done if my air flow keeps getting worse? And, um, is there a point where the stents or other treatments just stop working? I just want to understand what to expect and what my options might be if symptoms don\u2019t improve.",
