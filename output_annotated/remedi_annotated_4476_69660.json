As for my breathing, I do feel a bit more short of breath, but it hasn\u2019t suddenly gotten much worse all at once. It\u2019s just that steady increase in shortness of breath and needing more oxygen than usual.\n\nI\u2019m definitely feeling more anxious now, especially with everything you\u2019ve explained about the hemodynamic instability, metabolic acidosis, and the retroperitoneal bleed possibly getting worse. Should I be worried about this turning into respiratory failure or something happening with my heart? And if I do need a blood transfusion or other urgent intervention, how quickly does that usually happen? I just want to make sure I\u2019m safe and that we\u2019re not missing anything else important.",
