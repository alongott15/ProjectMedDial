Based on your medical history, recent surgery, and current symptoms\u2014including blood-tinged sputum, mucus plugs, back pain, and swelling\u2014it is possible that airway irritation and postoperative changes are contributing to your respiratory symptoms, even in the absence of infection. \n\nAt home, strategies such as staying well-hydrated, using a humidifier, and performing gentle airway clearance techniques (like controlled coughing or chest physiotherapy if recommended) may help reduce mucus plugs. For swelling, elevating your legs and monitoring your fluid intake as advised can be beneficial, but it is important to follow any specific instructions from your care team regarding volume management due to your history of acute renal failure.\n\nGiven your ongoing symptoms, I recommend close monitoring for any new or worsening shortness of breath, increased swelling, or signs of infection. Have you recently had a follow-up examination with your surgical or pulmonary team since discharge to reassess your airway and volume status?",

      "utterance_text": "Thank you, doctor, that\u2019s really helpful. Um, to answer your question\u2014I haven\u2019t had a follow-up with my surgical or pulmonary team yet since I was discharged. I\u2019ve mostly just been trying to manage symptoms at home, like keeping my legs elevated and watching my fluid intake like you mentioned. I do try to stay hydrated, but sometimes I worry about drinking too much because of the acute renal failure.\n\nI\u2019m definitely still feeling pretty uncomfortable, especially with the back pain and the mucus plugs\u2014sometimes it feels like I\u2019m just not getting enough relief. Is it important that I see my surgical or pulmonary team soon, or should I be coming in sooner if the blood-tinged sputum or swelling gets worse? And for the airway clearance\u2014are there specific techniques you recommend, or should I ask for a referral to someone who can show me chest physiotherapy?\n\nI just want to make sure I\u2019m doing everything right and not letting symptoms get worse. Thank you for taking the time to explain all this.",
