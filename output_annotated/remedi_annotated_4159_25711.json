Um, I have noticed some dizziness, especially when I try to sit up or stand\u2014it\u2019s like the room spins a little and I feel pretty unsteady. I haven\u2019t fainted, but I do feel weaker than usual, and sometimes I worry I might pass out if I\u2019m not careful. The palpitations are still there, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve gotten much worse since earlier\u2014just that fluttery feeling off and on.\n\nI really appreciate you keeping such a close eye on my cardiac rhythm, especially with my history of atrial fibrillation and now with the risk of arrhythmias from sepsis. Is there anything else I should be watching for? And, um, how soon do you think the pain and nausea might get better with the supportive care?
