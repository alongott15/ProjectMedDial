Um, I haven\u2019t really had chest pain that radiates to my arm or jaw\u2014it\u2019s more of a pressure or tightness in my chest that comes and goes, but it doesn\u2019t really spread anywhere else. The shortness of breath has definitely gotten worse, though, especially over the last couple days. Sometimes it feels like I just can\u2019t get enough air, even when I\u2019m sitting still.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve been having these headpains off and on\u2014they\u2019re not super severe, but they\u2019re there, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s related to everything else going on. With the low urine output, chills, lightheadedness, and now these headpains, I\u2019m just feeling really anxious. Should I be worried about all these symptoms happening together? And is there anything I should be doing at home while we wait for more test results?",
