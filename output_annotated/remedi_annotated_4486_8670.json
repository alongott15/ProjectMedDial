You should assessk immediate medical attention if you notice sudden worsening of shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, or if your right foot becomes cold, blue, or loses sensation entirely. \n\nTo guide further management, have you had a recent vascular ultrasound or Doppler examination of your right leg to assess arterial blood flow?",

I know my medical history is complicated, but hearing that there could be acute decompensation of my cardiac and pulmonary conditions, plus possible kidney involvement and compromised arterial circulation, is honestly pretty scary. Should I be worried that this could lead to something like losing my leg, or even something life-threatening?\n\nAlso, with all these symptoms piling up\u2014shortness of breath, hypoxia, clubbing, neuropathy getting worse, and now the right leg symptoms\u2014I\u2019ve been feeling pretty down and anxious.
