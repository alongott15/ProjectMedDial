My heart sometimes feels like it\u2019s beating a bit faster when I\u2019m short of breath, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s irregular or anything like that.\n\nActually, about the respiratory symptoms\u2014I still have this non-productive cough that just won\u2019t go away, and the hypoxia is really worrying me. My oxygen levels have been dropping below 90% at times, and that\u2019s pretty scary. I\u2019m using my oxygen at home, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t seem to help much.\n\nWith all these symptoms\u2014like the fatigue, weight loss, right leg pain, clubbing of my fingernails, and now the hypoxia and cough\u2014I\u2019m just not sure what to expect.

Based on your recent laboratory findings of elevated urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, and potassium, it\u2019s important to closely monitor your kidney function and muscle health, as well as continue managing your respiratory symptoms and vascular complications.\n\nI recommend arranging prompt follow-up laboratory diagnostic evaluations to assess your kidney function, electrolytes, and muscle enzymes, and discussing with your healthcare team whether adjustments to your medications or additional treatments\u2014such as diuretic therapy, anticoagulation, or pulmonary rehabilitation\u2014may be beneficial. In addition, addressing your mood symptoms is important; would you be open to a referral for mental health support or counseling to help manage your depression during this challenging time?",
