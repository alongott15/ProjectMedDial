That part\u2019s been normal for me, thankfully.\n\nBut now that I feel a bit more comfortable sharing, I did want to mention\u2014I\u2019ve noticed some nystagmus in all directions when I try to move my eyes. It\u2019s kind of unsettling, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s related to the stroke symptoms you mentioned. Also, there were a few moments where I just couldn\u2019t get any words out at all\u2014like complete anarthria, I think is the term. That was really scary.\n\nI appreciate you explaining the recovery steps and what to expect. Is there anything specific I should be doing right now to help with these symptoms? And do you think early therapy can really make a difference in getting back to my baseline?",
