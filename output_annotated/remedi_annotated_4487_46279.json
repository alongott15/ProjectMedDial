Sometimes I feel a little pressure or heaviness when my dyspnea gets really bad, but it goes away when I rest. As for palpitations, maybe just once or twice I felt my heart racing a bit when I was more short of breath, but it didn\u2019t last long.\n\nI appreciate you going over the symptoms I should watch for\u2014like increased work of breathing or bluish lips. That\u2019s helpful to know. Is there anything else I can do at home to help with the mucous production or to make breathing easier?
