Based on your description of copious mucous production, tachypnea with pauses while speaking, poor air movement, and increased work of breathing, my clinical assessment is that your respiratory condition may be unstable and could progress quickly.\n\nAt this point, I recommend assessking prompt medical attention\u2014either by contacting your healthcare provider or going to the emergency department\u2014if you experience any increased confusion, persistent oxygen saturation below 92%, severe fatigue with minimal activity, or worsening shortness of breath at rest. Have you had any recent changes in your ability to perform daily activities, such as difficulty eating, bathing, or moving around due to your respiratory symptoms?",

For example, just moving from one room to another or trying to get dressed leaves me more short of breath than usual. I\u2019ve even had to take breaks while bathing because I get so winded. Eating is okay, but sometimes I have to pause and catch my breath between bites.\n\nI appreciate you letting me know what warning signs to look out for\u2014like persistent oxygen saturation below 92% and increased fatigue. Should I be using my nebulizer treatments more often right now, or is there something else I should do at home until I can get seen? And, um, is it possible that this is more than just my usual asthma or COPD acting up? I just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing something serious.",
