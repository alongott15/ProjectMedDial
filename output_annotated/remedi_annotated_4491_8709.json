My right leg\u2019s still pain from that old femur fracture, but nothing new has happened to it.\n\nI appreciate you explaining what you\u2019re looking for with infection, metabolic disturbances, or neurological events. With all these symptoms\u2014like the somnolence, right-sided weakness, involuntary movements, and that coffee ground emesis\u2014I just feel really uncomfortable and a bit scared. Is there something serious going on? Should I be worried about infection or another TIA? And is there anything you can do to help me feel more comfortable while you figure this out? I just want some relief from all of this.",
