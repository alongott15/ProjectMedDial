      "utterance_text": "Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Um, let me think... I have had some mild abdominal pain, but it\u2019s not really sharp\u2014more like a dull pain that comes and goes. It\u2019s not the worst pain, but with the coffee ground emesis and everything else, I\u2019m definitely worried it could be something serious, like the gastrointestinal bleeding you mentioned.\n\nI really appreciate that you\u2019re taking this seriously and planning all those diagnostic evaluations and supportive care. I just want to feel better soon\u2014the hypoxia, tachypnea, fevers, chills, diaphoresis, and now this confusion and weakness are really making me uncomfortable. Is there anything else I should be doing right now, or anything I should watch out for while you\u2019re running these tests? And do you think I\u2019ll need to stay in the hospital for a while?",
