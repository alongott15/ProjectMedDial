I haven\u2019t had any nosebleeds, though. The bruising and the gum bleeding are definitely making me more anxious, especially with everything else going on\u2014like the chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.\n\nI think getting my hematocrit, complete blood count, and electrolytes examinationed again makes sense. Should I also get my INR examinationed to make sure my Coumadin level is in the right range? And if my labs show anemia or coagulopathy, would that change how you manage symptoms before we get the results of the echocardiogram? I just want to make sure nothing gets missed, especially since I\u2019m still feeling pretty unwell.",
