      "utterance_text": "Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, doctor. Um, since the last assessment, I haven\u2019t had any vomiting, but the abdominal pain does seem to get sharper at times, especially when I try to move or shift positions in bed. The distention is still there, and I\u2019m still not able to pass gas or have a proper bowel movement, so I\u2019m just feeling pretty uncomfortable overall.\n\nIs it normal for the abdominal pain and distention to stick around this long with a partial bowel obstruction? And is there anything else we can do to help relieve some of this discomfort while we wait for symptoms to improve? I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing everything I can to help my recovery, because it\u2019s getting a bit hard to stay positive with these symptoms hanging on.",
