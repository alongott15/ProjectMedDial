Based on your description\u2014worsening dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, mild weight gain, and abdominal bloating\u2014these findings suggest your heart failure may be progressing and warrant close monitoring and possible adjustment of your treatment plan.\n\nAt this point, I recommend that you continue to monitor your daily weight, fluid intake, and any new or worsening symptoms such as increased swelling, persistent cough, or chest discomfort. If you notice a weight gain of more than 2-3 pounds in a day or 5 pounds in a week, or if your symptoms worsen further, please contact our office promptly for further assessment.\n\nHave you had any recent laboratory assessments of your kidney function or electrolytes since these symptoms have worsened?
