I haven\u2019t really noticed much difference with temperature or pain, though. \n\nOne thing that\u2019s been bothering me a lot is the saliva dribbling out of the right corner of my mouth\u2014I just can\u2019t seem to control it. And, actually, I realized I can\u2019t read a sentence now, which is really frustrating. Is this all part of the same problem?
