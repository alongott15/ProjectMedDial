My eyesight seems about the same as usual, so I guess that\u2019s one thing that hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nI\u2019m still feeling pretty uncomfortable and honestly a bit anxious with all these neurological symptoms piling up. I just want to make sure we\u2019re not missing anything serious. Is there anything else I should be watching out for while we wait for the neuroimaging?

To further guide your assessment, have you experienced any recent changes in your ability to control bladder or bowel function, which can sometimes indicate involvement of specific areas of the brain or spinal cord?",
