These conditions can certainly explain your left-sided weakness, speech difficulties, and changes in your level of consciousness, and they do carry a risk for both worsening and long-term symptoms, though some recovery is possible depending on how your brain responds to treatment and time.\n\nAt this stage, our clinical assessment will focus on closely monitoring your neurological status for any changes\u2014such as new weakness, worsening confusion, or decreased responsiveness\u2014as well as preventing complications like seizures, infection, or further bleeding. Your care team will also continue supportive treatments, including careful blood pressure management, seizure prophylaxis, and monitoring for signs of increased intracranial pressure.\n\nGiven everything you\u2019ve shared, have you or your family noticed any sudden changes in your alertness or ability to respond during examination since your last assessment?",

There are times when I just can\u2019t seem to focus or answer, and other times I\u2019m a bit more alert. It kind of comes and goes, but overall I feel like I\u2019m not as interactive as I used to be.\n\nAlso, I wanted to mention\u2014I heard the team say there\u2019s minimal frontal soft tissue swelling and some dense fluid, probably hemorrhage, within my paranasal sinuses. Does that have anything to do with my symptoms, or is it something separate from the brain hemorrhages? I\u2019m just really anxious about all these findings and what they might mean for my recovery. Should I be worried about the swelling or the hemorrhage in my sinuses causing more symptoms?",
