The surgical team did come by and talked to me and my family about the situation. They explained that surgical decompression is pretty urgent because my abdomen is persistently distended and they measured my bladder pressures in the 20s, which I guess is really high. They said that\u2019s a sign of abdominal compartment syndrome and that it\u2019s putting a lot of stress on my organs.\n\nThey did go over some of the risks\u2014like bleeding, infection, and the fact that my heart and kidneys are already under a lot of strain because of my other medical symptoms. I understand that the surgery could help relieve the pressure and maybe improve my organ function, but I\u2019m worried about what could go wrong, especially since my blood pressure is so low and my labs keep getting worse.\n\nCould you maybe explain a bit more about what happens during surgical decompression? And with my high bladder pressures and everything else going on, is there a good chance my organs will recover if the surgery goes well? Or should I be worried about permanent damage?",

I do want to give myself a real chance at recovery, so I\u2019m okay with aggressive life-sustaining treatments like mechanical ventilation and resuscitation, at least for now, especially if there\u2019s a chance my organs could recover after the surgical decompression.\n\nBut, um\u2026 if it turns out during or after surgery that my organs aren\u2019t recovering, or if I end up needing prolonged life support with no real hope of getting back to a quality of life I\u2019d find acceptable, I wouldn\u2019t want to keep going with everything just for the sake of it. I\u2019d rather focus on comfort if symptoms look hopeless.\n\nIs it possible to try everything for now and then re-evaluate based on how I do after surgery? And, if symptoms don\u2019t improve, can my family and I talk with you and the team again about changing the plan? I just want to make sure I have a say in what happens, and that my family understands what\u2019s going on.",
