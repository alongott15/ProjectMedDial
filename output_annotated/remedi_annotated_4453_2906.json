With all these symptoms\u2014xerostomia, thick secretions, and the trouble swallowing\u2014I\u2019m starting to think it might be a good idea.\n\nWould a modified barium swallow help figure out exactly what\u2019s going on with my swallowing symptoms? And if they find something concerning, is there anything that can actually be done to make eating and drinking easier? I just want to get back to feeling more comfortable and not have to worry so much every time I try to eat.",
