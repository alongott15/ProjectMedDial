I haven\u2019t really felt like eating much, and I might not be drinking as much water as I should. My mouth has felt a bit dry at times, and I\u2019ve noticed I haven\u2019t been urinating as often. When I do go, the urine looks cloudy\u2014so, pyuria, I think? And like I mentioned before, there\u2019s been hematuria too.\n\nAlso, someone examinationed my heart rate during one of those episodes and said it was in the 30s\u2014so definite bradycardia. That seems pretty low to me. With all these symptoms\u2014altered mental status, bradycardia, hematuria, and pyuria\u2014do you think this could be something serious? Is there a chance it\u2019s all connected?",
