I don\u2019t really cough up much at all, and if I do, it\u2019s just a little bit and it\u2019s still clear\u2014not yellow or green or anything like that. So I guess I\u2019m not having any new symptoms with sputum.\n\nUm, I did want to ask about something else though. I remember last time when my sodium was low, I had a seizure, but right now they told me my sodium is at a similar level and I seem to be asymptomatic with sodium at this level. Does that mean it\u2019s less likely my seizure was from the sodium this time? Or could it still be related? I\u2019m just feeling really anxious with everything going on\u2014should I be worried about acute respiratory failure or congestive heart failure?",
