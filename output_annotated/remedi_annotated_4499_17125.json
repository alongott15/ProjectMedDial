      "utterance_text": "Well, um\u2026 I haven\u2019t really noticed any new fever or chills. My temperature seems to be about the same as usual, and I haven\u2019t had any sweats or shaking. But with all these symptoms\u2014like the shortness of breath, using my accessory muscles, and trouble speaking in full sentences\u2014I\u2019m honestly pretty scared about the possibility of respiratory failure or aspiration pneumonia. \n\nThank you for explaining about avoiding thin liquids and staying upright when eating or drinking. I\u2019ll definitely do that until I can get a formal swallowing assessment. Is there anything else I should watch out for, like certain symptoms that mean symptoms are getting worse? And, um, if my oxygen saturation drops even lower or my breathing gets harder, would that mean I\u2019d need to go on a breathing machine? I just want to know what to expect and how serious this could get.",
