Um, yes, I have had some fever spikes\u2014my temperature\u2019s been up and down, and I\u2019ve definitely had chills, sometimes even shaking a bit, which I think you\u2019d call rigors. I haven\u2019t really had any other obvious signs of infection, like a cough with sputum or anything like that, but the fevers and chills have definitely been there.\n\nI\u2019m honestly pretty anxious about all of this, especially now that you mention hemodynamic instability and the risk of significant blood loss. With my history of amyloidosis and being on coumadin, I know symptoms can get complicated quickly. Should I be worried about sepsis or something like that? And if it does turn out to be a pneumothorax or heart failure, what kinds of treatments would I need? \n\nIs there anything else I should be watching for at home, or any specific symptoms that mean I need to go to the emergency department right away? I just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing anything urgent.",
