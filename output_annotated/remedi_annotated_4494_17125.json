I just haven\u2019t felt as hungry, and sometimes I have to remind myself to eat. As for fluids, I might be drinking a little less than usual too, but it\u2019s hard to say for sure\u2014I just haven\u2019t felt very thirsty. Could that be making my symptoms worse?\n\nThank you for explaining everything so clearly. I\u2019m definitely feeling anxious, but I appreciate you telling me what to watch out for and when to call an ambulance. Is there anything else I should mention to the hospital team when I get there, especially about my SIADH or the low sodium and chloride? And, um, is there anything they might do right away to help with the confusion and shortness of breath?",
