Um, as far as I can remember, I haven\u2019t had any changes in my medication dosages, and I haven\u2019t started any new prescriptions lately. I\u2019m still taking the same medicines\u2014Atrovent, Albuterol, Propoxyphene, Hydromorphone, Klonopin, Ranitidine, Megace, and Lactulose syrup. I try to be careful with them, especially since you mentioned some of these could affect my sodium levels or contribute to SIADH.\n\nI do feel a bit overwhelmed with all these symptoms\u2014confusion, headpains, muscle weakness, and now the loss of appetite. It\u2019s just a lot at once, and I\u2019m worried about something serious happening with this hyponatremia. Should I be examinationing my sodium levels more often? And is there anything specific I should watch out for at home besides worsening confusion or severe headpain?\n\nAlso, if you do need to adjust my medications or fluids, how quickly can I expect to start feeling better? I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing everything right while we work on getting my sodium back to normal.",
