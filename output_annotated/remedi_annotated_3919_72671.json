I\u2019ve also had people mention that I look really pale\u2014like, my complexion is definitely more pallid than usual.\n\nAnd during some of those episodes, I was told I had sinus tachycardia. That\u2019s when my heart rate gets really fast, right? It\u2019s honestly making me more anxious, because it feels like all these symptoms\u2014fatigue, weight loss, pallor, the tachycardia\u2014are adding up to something serious. Should I be really worried about this? Is there anything I can do to help improve my blood counts or manage these symptoms?",
