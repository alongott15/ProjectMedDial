It\u2019s not something I really paid attention to until recently, but it does seem like I\u2019m not going as much. The swelling is mostly in my left lower leg, but sometimes my fingers look a bit bluish too, which worries me.\n\nAnd, actually, even though I\u2019m on oxygen, my breathing still feels really effortful. It\u2019s like I\u2019m working hard just to get air in, and sometimes it feels like there\u2019s not much air moving in my lungs. I remember one of the nurses said she heard crackles in the bases when she listened to my lungs. Is that something I should be worried about? \n\nI just feel like everything is getting harder, and I\u2019m anxious about what all these symptoms mean for my heart and lungs.",
