      "utterance_text": "Well, um, I\u2019ve actually never had a blood transfusion before, so I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d have any kind of reaction. I\u2019ve had intravenous medications in the hospital after my surgeries\u2014like antibiotics and fluids\u2014and I don\u2019t remember having any conditions with those. No rashes or trouble breathing or anything like that.\n\nI am still feeling pretty anxious about all of this, especially with the possibility of needing plasma transfusion and intravenous vitamin K. Is there anything I should watch out for during those treatments? And with the EGD, are there special precautions you\u2019ll take because of my coronary artery disease and chronic renal insufficiency? I just want to make sure everything is as safe as possible while we try to get the bleeding under control and manage my anemia and anginal symptoms.",

Based on your assessment\u2014including bright red blood per ostomy, elevated INR and PT, and your medical history of coronary artery disease and chronic renal insufficiency\u2014my clinical recommendation is to proceed with supportive care: this includes intravenous fluids, correction of your coagulopathy with vitamin K and possibly plasma, close cardiac and renal monitoring, and urgent EGD to identify and control the source of bleeding. During these treatments, we will monitor you closely for any signs of transfusion reaction (such as rash, fever, or shortness of breath) and adjust medications to protect your heart and kidneys.
