I wasn\u2019t sure if it was related to all the vomiting and diarrhea, but now I\u2019m worried it could be something with my liver since you mentioned that.\n\nAlso, I did examination my temperature at home and it was over 101.5\u00b0F a couple times in the past few days. I\u2019ve just felt so weak and achy, with those shaking chills you talked about. \n\nIs it possible that all these symptoms\u2014like the jaundice, the dark vomit and stools, and the abdominal tenderness\u2014are connected? Should I be worried about something like an infection spreading or liver failure? I\u2019m really uncomfortable and just want to know what can be done to help me feel better.",
