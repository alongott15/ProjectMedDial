Delirium can occur with severe infections, metabolic disturbances, or fluid overload\u2014especially in people with complex medical histories like yours. My assessment is that your symptoms may be interconnected due to infection, inflammation, and possible heart failure exacerbation.\n\nIt\u2019s important to assessk immediate medical attention if you notice any recurrence of altered mental status, worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or rapid increase in swelling. Are you able to arrange for someone to help monitor your symptoms at home in case your condition changes suddenly?",

I am still pretty anxious, especially since I\u2019ve never had delirium before, and the high fever and all these symptoms together just make me worried something serious is going on. I do have a neighbor who examinations in on me most days, and my daughter calls every evening, so I can let them know to keep an eye out for any changes in my mental status, shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling.\n\nActually, I wanted to ask about something else\u2014they mentioned my liver function tests were abnormal, and I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m volume overloaded. Does that mean the infection or inflammation is affecting my liver too? And is there anything specific I should do about the volume overload besides watching my weight and swelling?
