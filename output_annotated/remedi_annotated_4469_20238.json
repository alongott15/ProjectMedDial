But I am still really anxious about all these neurological symptoms, especially with the left-sided weakness and decreased responsiveness.\n\nAlso, I wanted to mention that I\u2019ve had some swelling and tenderness, mostly in my legs and ankles. The swelling\u2019s gotten worse lately, and it feels pretty uncomfortable\u2014sometimes even painful to touch. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s related to the acute renal failure or the electrolyte abnormalities, but it\u2019s definitely something new for me.\n\nI agree it sounds important to get a brain MRI or CT scan soon, just to be sure we\u2019re not missing a stroke or something serious. If it does turn out to be metabolic encephalopathy from the renal failure and all these lab abnormalities, is there a good chance my symptoms could improve with treatment? Or should I be worried about permanent damage? And is there anything else I should be doing right now to help with the swelling and tenderness?",
