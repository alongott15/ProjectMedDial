I guess that could be from the fluid overload you mentioned.\n\nActually, there have been times when I wasn\u2019t really able to answer questions\u2014like, I\u2019d just sort of respond if someone talked to me, but I couldn\u2019t really say much myself. My family said I was only responding to verbal stimuli on those days. That\u2019s been pretty scary for them and for me.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve had a lot more trouble swallowing lately\u2014dysphagia, I think you call it? It\u2019s made eating and drinking harder, and I worry about aspirating with all these secretions.\n\nWith all these symptoms\u2014shortness of breath, productive cough, edema, hematuria, dysphagia\u2014should I be really concerned about something serious? Is this something that can be managed at home, or do I need to be in the hospital?",
