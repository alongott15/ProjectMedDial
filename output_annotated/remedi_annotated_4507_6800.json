Based on your symptoms, medical history, and recent findings of fever and chills, it is possible that an infection\u2014such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or sepsis\u2014could be contributing to your confusion and somnolence, and this can certainly worsen hepatic encephalopathy. Starting lactulose may help improve your mental status, sometimes within a day or two, but treating any underlying infection is also critical for your recovery.\n\nTo guide our ongoing assessment, have you recently had a diagnostic paracentesis or blood cultures performed to evaluate for infection in your ascitic fluid or bloodstream?",

Or maybe I just don\u2019t remember because I\u2019ve been so out of it lately.\n\nHonestly, I just feel really uncomfortable and kind of scared with all these symptoms\u2014especially the confusion, fevers, and chills. If it is something like spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or sepsis, how serious is that? And if you do need to do a paracentesis, what should I expect? Will it help me feel any better?
