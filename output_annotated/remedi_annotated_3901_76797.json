Based on your medical history and current symptoms\u2014including acute kidney injury, pulmonary congestion, and atrial fibrillation\u2014it\u2019s important to closely monitor for any signs of worsening shortness of breath, decreased urine output, or confusion, as these could indicate progression of heart failure or infection. As part of your ongoing assessment, have you noticed any new swelling in your hands, feet, or around your eyes that could suggest fluid retention? \n\nIn terms of treatment, it will be important to continue your prescribed medications for heart rate control and anticoagulation, follow fluid and salt restrictions as advised, and attend all follow-up appointments for laboratory monitoring and clinical evaluation.
