Um, let me think\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve noticed any really irregular heartbeats or skipped beats\u2014at least nothing that stood out to me. It\u2019s mostly just been the tachycardia and palpitations, like my heart is beating faster than usual, but not really out of rhythm. I guess sometimes it feels a little fluttery, but I\u2019m not sure if that counts as irregular.\n\nI am pretty anxious about all these symptoms, especially with the electrolyte imbalances you mentioned. Should I be worried about something happening to my heart or nerves because of the high potassium and phosphate? Is there anything I should do right now to help lower those levels, or is it just a matter of adjusting my hemodialysis? And are there any warning signs I should watch for while I\u2019m waiting for treatment?",

I do have some mild nausea off and on, but it\u2019s not severe, and I haven\u2019t had any vomiting or abdominal pain. My appetite is still pretty poor, though, which I guess could be making symptoms worse.\n\nI appreciate you being so thorough with your assessment. With my multiple myeloma and amyloidosis, is there a higher risk that these electrolyte imbalances could get out of control even if I\u2019m doing everything right with my hemodialysis? And is there anything else I can do to help stabilize symptoms, or is it mostly just about keeping up with my treatments and watching for those warning signs you mentioned? I just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing anything important.",

Based on my clinical assessment, your current symptoms and laboratory findings suggest that close monitoring and possible adjustment of your dialysis regimen are needed to help stabilize your electrolyte levels and prevent complications. In addition to watching for acute symptoms like chest pain, severe muscle weakness, or changes in mental status, have you noticed any new bleeding or unusual bruising, which can sometimes occur with underlying hematologic conditions?",
