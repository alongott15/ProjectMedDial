To help improve motility, try eating small, frequent meals that are low in fiber and easy to digest, maintain adequate hydration, and engage in gentle physical activity as tolerated.\n\nHave you been able to maintain adequate fluid intake, and are you experiencing any symptoms of dehydration such as increased thirst, dry mouth, or reduced urine output?",

I think that would help give me some peace of mind, too, just to make sure everything is healing the way it should.\n\nThank you for explaining about the delayed gastrointestinal motility and the mild electrolyte disturbances\u2014I feel a little better knowing these symptoms aren\u2019t uncommon after a hemicolectomy and sigmoid resection with an ileostomy. I\u2019ll keep monitoring my ileostomy output and symptoms every day, and I\u2019ll try to include more potassium-rich foods as long as I can tolerate them.\n\nJust to double-examination\u2014if I do notice a significant decrease or cessation in my ileostomy output, or if I develop severe abdominal pain or persistent vomiting, I should seek immediate medical attention, right? And is there anything else I should be watching for that might suggest a complication?\n\nThank you again for being so thorough and patient with all my questions. It really helps me feel more hopeful about my recovery.",
