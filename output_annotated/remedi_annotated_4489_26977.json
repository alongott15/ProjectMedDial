Other than that one really scary episode where I lost my pulse and breathing, I have had a few moments where I felt kind of lightheaded or maybe a little confused\u2014like I wasn\u2019t quite myself for a minute or two. It\u2019s hard to say if I actually lost consciousness, but I definitely felt off.\n\nI\u2019m still feeling pretty anxious about all of this. If it is something like acute heart failure or a pulmonary embolism, is there a good chance for recovery if we act quickly? And, um\u2026 what should I expect once I\u2019m admitted to the hospital? Will I need to stay for a long time? I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing everything I can to get better.",
