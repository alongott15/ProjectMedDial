It\u2019s definitely worse lately. \n\nAlso, um, I wanted to mention that my abdomen feels really tender, especially around the belly button area\u2014like diffuse tenderness to palpation periumbilical, I think you\u2019d call it. And I\u2019ve noticed these bruises\u2014ecchymoses\u2014on both of my upper arms, but I don\u2019t remember bumping into anything. \n\nAll of this together is making me pretty anxious. Should I be worried that these symptoms are all happening at once?",
