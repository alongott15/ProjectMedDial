I\u2019m on warfarin, so I try to be careful, but lately it seems like even a small bump leaves a mark. I haven\u2019t had any major bleeding, though\u2014no nosebleeds or blood in my urine or anything like that.\n\nThank you for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate you taking the time to go over all these symptoms and what to watch out for. I\u2019ll make sure to keep an eye on symptoms like fever, jaundice, or worsening shortness of breath, and I\u2019ll try to stay hydrated and eat as well as I can.\n\nIs there anything specific I should do if I notice more bruising or if my symptoms get worse before my neurological examination and echocardiogram? And with all these symptoms\u2014like the somnolence, right-sided weakness, and poor endurance\u2014do you think there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll get back to my normal self, or should I expect a longer recovery? I just want to feel comfortable again and not so limited.",

Based on your persistent right-sided weakness, exertional dyspnea, somnolence, and increased bruising while on warfarin, my clinical assessment is that you may be experiencing a combination of deconditioning, possible neurological changes, and effects related to your cardiac and hepatic function; your mild anemia may also be contributing to your poor endurance.\n\nI recommend proceeding with a neurological examination and brain imaging, as well as a formal cardiac assessment (such as an echocardiogram) to further evaluate your symptoms. Physical therapy will be essential for rehabilitation and regaining strength. Please continue to monitor for any signs of active bleeding (such as nosebleeds, blood in urine or stool, or significant bruising), and if these occur or if your neurological symptoms worsen suddenly, assessk immediate medical attention.\n\nWhile recovery can take time after major surgery, especially with your medical history, many patients do improve with targeted rehabilitation and close monitoring. Have you had your most recent INR (international normalized ratio) examineed to ensure your warfarin therapy is within the therapeutic range?",

I know they try to keep it in the right range because of the warfarin, but with all the bruising I\u2019ve been having, maybe it\u2019s a bit too high?

I\u2019m definitely interested in starting physical therapy and getting the neurological examination and brain imaging done. Is there anything else I should be doing at home to help with the deconditioning or to manage my poor endurance while we wait for these assessments?\n\nAnd, um, do you think it\u2019s likely that my symptoms\u2014like the right-sided weakness and somnolence\u2014will improve with time and therapy, or should I prepare for a longer recovery?
