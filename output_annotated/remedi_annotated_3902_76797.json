I recommend daily weight examination, keeping a written log of your symptoms and measurements, and obtaining a home blood pressure monitor if possible; please notify me if your blood pressure is consistently below 100/60 mmHg or above 160/90 mmHg, or if you gain more than 2 pounds in a day or 5 pounds in a week.\n\nFor my ongoing assessment, have you had any recent laboratory evaluations of your INR to ensure your anticoagulation is within the therapeutic range?",

I\u2019ll start keeping a written log of my symptoms, daily weights, and\u2014once I get a blood pressure monitor\u2014those numbers too. It\u2019s just a lot to keep track of, especially with the heart failure, anticoagulation, and now the reflux and possible aspiration.
