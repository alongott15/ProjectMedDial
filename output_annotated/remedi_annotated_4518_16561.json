I wasn\u2019t sure if it was related, but with the moderate suprapubic tenderness and this abdominal distension I\u2019ve been having, it\u2019s starting to worry me more.\n\nAlso, my fever\u2019s still been pretty high\u2014like, the Tmax was 102.4 even after the procedure. I just feel really unwell overall. Is this something that could get worse? Should I be worried about it spreading or turning into something more serious?",
