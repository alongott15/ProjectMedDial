And there have been a few nights where I woke up short of breath, which I guess is what you called paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea?\n\nWith all these symptoms\u2014like the low blood pressure, the swelling in my legs, and the chest discomfort\u2014I\u2019m really starting to worry something serious is going on with my heart or maybe my kidneys. Is this something that can get better, or should I be preparing for something more serious?",
