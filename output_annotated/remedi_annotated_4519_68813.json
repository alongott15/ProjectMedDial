I haven\u2019t had severe difficulty breathing\u2014just that shortness of breath when the chest pain happens, but I can still breathe okay most of the time. I haven\u2019t felt confused, just really anxious and shaky when my fever goes up. I\u2019m able to keep fluids down, but it\u2019s been harder to eat because of the mouth ulcers and the pain in my left cheek.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just worried about how quickly all these symptoms have gotten worse\u2014especially the fever, chills, and the discharge with odor from the incision. Is there anything I should do right now before heading to the hospital? And, um, should I bring all my current medications with me? I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing everything right.",
