This typically includes an electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzyme blood diagnostic evaluations, chest X-ray, and possibly an echocardiogram to evaluate your heart function.\n\nGiven the severity and progression of your symptoms, you should be prepared for the possibility of a hospital admission for close monitoring and treatment.
