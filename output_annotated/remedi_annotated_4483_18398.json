Sometimes I just feel kind of foggy or it takes me longer to find the right words, and there have been a couple of times where I just felt really tired all of a sudden, like I could barely keep my eyes open. I thought maybe it was just from not sleeping well because of the shortness of breath, but now I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nI\u2019m really anxious about all these symptoms\u2014especially now that you mentioned heart failure and possible kidney symptoms. Should I be going to the hospital right now? Is there anything I should be doing at home while I wait for more tests? And is this something that can get better, or is it likely to get worse?",

The chest pain I get is more of a pressure or heaviness, not sharp. As for weakness, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had sudden weakness just on one side, but sometimes my left hand does feel numb or a little weaker than usual. And with the difficulty speaking\u2014I have had those episodes of garbled speech, but nothing that\u2019s come on all of a sudden in the last few hours.\n\nShould I bring anything specific with me to the hospital? And is there anything I should watch out for on the way there\u2014like if the chest pain gets worse or if I suddenly can\u2019t speak or move one side?
