Um, let me think\u2026 I haven\u2019t had any ongoing loss of vision or double vision\u2014just those brief episodes of blurred vision when the other symptoms start up. Most of the time, my eyesight goes back to normal after a few minutes. But it\u2019s definitely scary when it happens.\n\nI really appreciate you taking this seriously. With all these neurological symptoms\u2014like the weakness, numbness, garbled speech, difficulty swallowing, and severe headpains\u2014plus my history of skull base malformation and encephalocele, I\u2019m just so anxious about what could be going on. \n\nIs there anything I should be doing right now while I wait for the imaging studies? Should I avoid certain activities or foods? And, um, if this turns out to be a complication from my encephalocele or something like a stroke, what kind of treatments or interventions should I expect? I just want to be as prepared as possible.",
