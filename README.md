## Features ✨

- **Dialogue Simulation**: Simulates doctor-patient conversations using sophisticated agent models. 🗣️
- **Annotation**: Annotates dialogues using the ReMeDi framework, identifying intents, actions, and medical slots. ✍️
- **Realistic Dialogue Generation**: Includes features like empathetic responses, systematic medical inquiry, and natural conversation flow for creating realistic medical dialogues. 🌿
- **Advanced Validation**: Validates medical accuracy, clinical coherence, and dialogue safety using MIMIC-III knowledge base and LLM-based assessments. ✅
- **Quality Assessment**: Provides comprehensive quality scores for generated dialogues and annotations, including completeness, accuracy, consistency, and medical relevance. 💯
- **SOTA (State of The Art) Evaluation**: Uses the coach agent (summarizer_agent, validator_agent) to evaluate the generated dialogs. 
- **GTMF (Ground Truth Medical Form) Extraction**: Utilizes Azure AI to extract key information from medical notes, structuring it for analysis. 📝
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simulates gradual information disclosure from patients for more realistic interactions.
- **Medical Vocabulary Enhancement**: Improves semantic scores by replacing common words with medical equivalents. 📚

## Tech Stack 💻

## Installation 🛠️

1. **Clone the Repository**: ⬇️
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alongott15/ProjectMedDial
   cd ProjectMedDial
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: virtualenv is used in this project.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux and macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: ⚙️
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Based on the `requirements.txt` file, the following packages are required:
   ```text
   transformers>=4.30.0
   torch>=2.0.0        
   pydantic>=1.10.2
   sqlalchemy>=1.4.0
   scikit-learn>=1.2.0
   sentence-transformers # New SOTA validator
   azure-ai-inference # New for GTMFAgent
   python-dotenv
   nltk
   rouge-score
   ```

4. **Configure Azure AI Credentials**: 🔑
   - Set the `AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_AI_API_KEY` environment variables. This can be done by creating a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```text
     AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_ai_endpoint
     AZURE_AI_API_KEY=your_azure_ai_api_key
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
     ```

5. **Configure MIMIC-III Database Connection**: ⚙️
   - Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your MIMIC-III database connection string.
     ```text
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
     ```

## Usage 🚀

1. **Run Dialogue Simulation**: 🗣️
   - Execute `dialogue_main.py` to generate medical dialogues. The simulation leverages patient and doctor agents, and their interaction is evaluated using a coach agent. 
     ```bash
     python dialogue_main.py
     ```

2. **Run Annotation Process**: ✍️
   - Execute `annotation_main.py` to annotate the generated dialogues using the ReMeDi framework. This script processes dialogue files and annotates them with relevant medical information.
     ```bash
     python annotation_main.py
     ```

3. **Validate Annotations**: ✅
   - Run `annotation_validation.py` to validate the annotations using a realistic scoring system that includes medical validation and safety assessments. This step ensures the quality and reliability of the annotations.
     ```bash
     python annotation_validation.py
     ```

### Key Use Cases:

- **Improving AI-driven Medical Consultations**: Validating and refining AI systems used in medical consultations by simulating dialogues and identifying areas for improvement.
- **Enhancing Medical Training**: Providing realistic scenarios for medical training and education, where students can practice communication and diagnostic skills.
- **Generating High-Quality Annotated Data**: Creating a dataset of annotated medical dialogues for training and evaluating NLP models in the medical domain.

### Example Scenario:

A researcher wants to create a dataset of high-quality annotated medical dialogues. They use `dialogue_main.py` to generate dialogues, then use `annotation_main.py` to annotate them. Finally, they use `annotation_validation.py` to validate and refine the annotations, ensuring the dataset is accurate and reliable.
