Your task is to extract a structured Ground Truth Medical Form (GTMF) from the following clinical note and metadata for a light, common medical case.

Identify only symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments that are clearly supported by the text.

If the diagnosis or treatment is not clearly documented, mark it as unknown or leave the field empty.

Do not upgrade a mild/light case into a severe one, and do not add ICU-level events if they are not present.

Output a JSON object following the GTMF schema provided.
