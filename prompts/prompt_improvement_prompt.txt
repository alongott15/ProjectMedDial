You receive:
1. A synthetic dialogue between a doctor and a patient.
2. An evaluation with decision, score, and feedback.

Your task is to propose small, targeted adjustments to the doctor and patient prompts that could improve the next dialogue attempt, while maintaining all safety and grounding constraints.

You MUST keep the bias-aware and anti-hallucination instructions intact.

Focus on things like: more open-ended questions, better organization of the consultation, or clearer expression by the patient.

Output a concise JSON with new or modified prompt snippets or flags.
