The doctor\u2019s approach is safe, empathetic, and patient-centered; the patient\u2019s behavior is believable; and the dialogue serves a clear medical purpose with logical progression.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nThe dialogue meets criteria for realism and clinical appropriateness.\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb Calibrated Decision Analysis:\n\u2705 REALISTIC - Expert assessment confirmed (Safety: 0.870)\n\ud83d\udcc8 Calibrated Score Breakdown:\n  \u2022 Expert Assessment: 0.500/0.5 (Realistic)\n  \u2022 Safety Evaluation: 0.261/0.3 (Score: 0.870)\n  \u2022 SOTA Metrics: 0.131/0.2 (Disclosure: 0.700)\n\ud83c\udfaf Key Factor: Expert assessment prioritized over automated metrics\n\ud83d\udd27 Adaptive Threshold: 0.650",
