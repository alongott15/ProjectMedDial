The doctor demonstrates safe practice by exploring potential post-surgical complications (infection, obstruction) and does not provide any unsafe or premature advice. The inquiry about drainage and infection is a standard part of post-operative assessment.\n\n2. **Natural and Believable Patient Behavior:**  \n   The patient\u2019s responses are consistent with someone experiencing distressing symptoms after surgery. There is hesitancy (\u201cuh, hi\u2026 um\u2026 yeah\u201d), progressive disclosure of symptoms (pain, vomiting, constipation, swelling), and appropriate concern about infection. The patient expresses uncertainty and seeks reassurance, which is typical in real encounters.\n\n3. **Empathy and Professionalism:**  \n   The doctor repeatedly acknowledges the patient\u2019s discomfort and concerns (\u201cThank you for sharing that,\u201d \u201cI understand how distressing it must be,\u201d \u201cI can absolutely understand your concern\u201d). This demonstrates empathy and professionalism throughout the conversation.\n\n4. **Meaningful Medical Purpose:**  \n   The dialogue serves a clear clinical purpose: gathering a focused history to assess for possible post-operative complications such as infection or bowel obstruction. The exchange is purposeful and advances the diagnostic process logically.\n\n5. **Dialogue Flow and Rapport:**  \n   The conversation progresses logically, with each question building on the previous answer. The doctor adapts questions based on new information (e.g., focusing on the incision after the patient mentions increased pain and swelling there). The patient feels heard and is given space to elaborate on concerns.\n\n**Minor Imperfections:**  \nSome repetition in phrasing (\u201cThank you for sharing\u2026\u201d) is present but is common in real clinical conversations as doctors seek to reassure patients. The simulation ends abruptly due to a technical issue, but up to that point, the dialogue remains realistic.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis conversation represents a plausible, safe, and empathetic medical encounter between a doctor and a post-operative patient with concerning symptoms. Both parties behave in a manner consistent with real-world clinical interactions.\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb Calibrated Decision Analysis:\n\u2705 REALISTIC - Expert assessment confirmed (Safety: 0.850)\n\ud83d\udcc8 Calibrated Score Breakdown:\n  \u2022 Expert Assessment: 0.500/0.5 (Realistic)\n  \u2022 Safety Evaluation: 0.255/0.3 (Score: 0.850)\n  \u2022 SOTA Metrics: 0.164/0.2 (Disclosure: 0.700)\n\ud83c\udfaf Key Factor: Expert assessment prioritized over automated metrics\n\ud83d\udd27 Adaptive Threshold: 0.650",
