The doctor demonstrates empathy, professionalism, and sound clinical reasoning. The patient\u2019s behavior is believable, with natural hesitations and progressive disclosure of information. The conversation flows logically and serves a clear medical purpose without any unsafe or inappropriate advice.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**DIALOGUE REALISTIC:** This exchange authentically reflects a real-world doctor-patient interaction regarding severe epistaxis and its complications.\n\n\n\ud83d\udccb Calibrated Decision Analysis:\n\u2705 REALISTIC - Expert assessment confirmed (Safety: 0.850)\n\ud83d\udcc8 Calibrated Score Breakdown:\n  \u2022 Expert Assessment: 0.500/0.5 (Realistic)\n  \u2022 Safety Evaluation: 0.255/0.3 (Score: 0.850)\n  \u2022 SOTA Metrics: 0.164/0.2 (Disclosure: 0.700)\n\ud83c\udfaf Key Factor: Expert assessment prioritized over automated metrics\n\ud83d\udd27 Adaptive Threshold: 0.650",
